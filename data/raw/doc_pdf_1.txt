 1 1. Introduction 
1.1 Authority  
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed this document in furtherance of its 
statutory responsibilities under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, 
Public Law 107- 347.  
 NIST is responsible for developing  standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, for 
providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets; but such standards and 
guidelines shall not apply to national security systems.  This guideline is consistent with the requirements 
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A -130, Section 8b(3), “Securing Agency 
Information Systems,” as analyzed in A -130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections.  Supplemental 
information is provided in A -130, Appendix III.  
 
This guideline has been prepared for use by Federal agencies.  It may be used by nongovernmental 
organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright, though attribution is desired.  
 
Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict sta ndards and guidelines made mandatory and 
binding on Federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority, nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the Secretary of Commerce, 
Direct or of the OMB, or any other Federal official.  
 
1.2 Purpose and Scope  
Cloud computing is an evolving paradigm . The NIST definition characterizes important aspects of cloud 
computing and is intended to serve as a means for broad comparisons of cloud services and deployment 
strategies, and to provide a baseline for discussion from what is cloud computing to how to best use cloud 
computing.  The service and deployment models defined form a simple taxonomy that is not intended to 
prescribe or constrain any particula r method of deployment, service delivery, or business operation.  
 
1.3 Audience  
The intended audience  of this document  is system planners , program managers,  technologists,  and others 
adopting cloud computing as consumers or providers of  cloud services.  
 2 2. The NIS T Definition of Cloud Computing  
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on- demand network access to a shared 
pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that 
can be rapidly  provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction . 
This cloud model is composed of five  essential  characteristics, three  service models, and four  deployment 
models . 
 
Essential Characteristics:  
On-demand self -service.  A consumer can unilaterally provision computing c apabilities , such as 
server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human 
interaction with each service provider.  
Broad network access . Capabilities are available over the networ k and  accessed through standard 
mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous  thin or thick client platforms (e.g., 
mobile phones, tablets,  laptops, and workstations ). 
Resource pooling. The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple  consume rs 
using a multi -tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically 
assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exa ct 
location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of 
abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage, 
processing, memory, and network bandwidth.  
Rapid elasticity . Capabiliti es can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases 
automatically, to scale rapidly out ward and in ward commensurate with  demand. To the 
consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can 
be appropriated in any quantity  at any time.  
Measured service.  Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging 
a metering capability
1 at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., 
storage, processing, bandwidth, and active  user accounts ). Resource usage can be 
monitored, controlled, and reported,  providing transparency for both the provider and 
consumer of the utilized service.  
 
Service Models:  
Software as a S ervice  (SaaS). The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider’s 
applications running on a cloud infrastructure2. The applications are accessible from 
various client devices through  either  a thin client interface , such as a web browser (e.g., 
web-based email) , or a program interface. The consumer  does not  manage or control the 
underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or 
even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user -
specific application configuration settings. 
Platform as  a Servic e (PaaS) . The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud 
infrastructure consumer -created or acquired applications created using programming 
                                                      
1 Typically this is done on a pay -per-use or charge-per -use basis . 
2 A cloud infrastructure is the collection of hardware and software that enables the five essential characteristics of cloud 
computing. The cloud infrast ructure can be viewed as containing both a physical layer and an abstraction layer. The physical 
layer consists of the hardware resources that are necessary to support the cloud services being provided, and typically includes 
server, storage and network co mponents. The abstraction layer consists of the software deployed across the physical layer, 
which manifests the essential cloud characteristics.  Conceptually the abstraction layer sits above the physical layer.  
 3 languages, libraries, services,  and tools supported by the provider.3 The consumer does 
not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, 
operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly 
configuration settings for the application -hosting environment. 
Infrastructur e as a Service  (IaaS). The capability provided to the consumer is to provision 
processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating 
systems and  applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud 
infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications ; 
and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).  
 
Deployment Models:  
Private cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization 
comprising  multiple consu mers (e.g., business units) . It may be owned, managed, and 
operated by the organization , a third party , or some combi nation of them, and it may exist 
on or off premise s. 
Community cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific 
community  of consumers from organizations  that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, 
security requirements, policy , and compliance considerations ). It may be owned, 
managed , and operated by one or more of  the organizations  in the community, a third 
party , or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises . 
Public  cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisi oned for open use by the general public . It may be 
owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or 
some combination of them.  It exists on the premises of the cloud provider . 
Hybrid cloud. The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud  
infrastructure s (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities , but are bound 
together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability  (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds).   
  
                                                      
3 This capability does not necessarily preclude the use of compatible  programming languages, libraries, services , and tools from 
other sources.
