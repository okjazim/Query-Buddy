Background and motivation
Calls for technology sovereignty in Europe were becoming louder even before the 
current Corona crisis. Growing geopolitical uncertainties and the threat of global 
trade conflicts are questioning the optimism of recent decades concerning the 
interdependence of our economies. In Germany, this is triggering a discussion 
about how independent a state or a federation of states must and can be with 
regard to critical technologies. It becomes clear that there is an increasing conflict 
between the call for technology sovereignty on the one hand, and the dominant 
economic model on the other, in which global specialization and the division of 
labor combined with open trade increases the welfare of all. Germany, in particu -
lar, as an export nation, and the EU as an economic area must consider the ques -
tion of technology sovereignty carefully and in a differentiated manner.   
We present one conception of technology sovereignty in this position paper.    
Our intention is to enrich the current debate and improve differentiation. We 
develop the criteria and key analytical steps needed to determine the criticality 
of technologies and the degree of technology sovereignty. Building on this, we 
develop modified strategies to safeguard or to produce technology sovereignty.
 
2  |  3What is technology sovereignty?
We define technology sovereignty as the ability of a state or a federation of  
states to provide the technologies it deems critical for its welfare, competitive -
ness, and ability to act, and to be able to develop these or source them from 
other eco nomic areas without one-sided structural dependency.
Our definition of technology sovereignty therefore does not imply comprehensive 
technology autarky that questions the international division of labor and global -
ization and aims at providing every technology classified as critical. Primarily, it 
describes preserving options by developing and maintaining own capabilities and 
avoiding one-sided dependencies. Technology sovereignty is therefore a neces -
sary, but by no means sufficient condition for the self-determined creation and 
diffusion of critical innovations (innovation sovereignty) and therefore for self-  
determined economic trade (economic sovereignty). It is insufficient to focus on 
technology sovereignty alone.

How do we determine whether  
technology sovereignty exists and 
whether we should pursue it?
Analytical steps
While from the viewpoint of the state, the aim is often to 
achieve technological competitiveness  in as many areas as 
possible, we propose a more differentiated and selective 
approach to determining whether sovereignty exists or is 
indeed required for a specific technology:
 The first step is to analyze whether a technology is 
currently critical , meaning indispensable (or will be critical 
in future) and why, and to what extent access to it could 
be threatened by external shocks. 
 The second step is to differentiate precisely in which 
functional  context  a technology is critical. Here, we 
distinguish between a technology’s contribution to 
economic competitiveness , its contribution to meeting key 
societal needs  such as healthcare, for example, or energy 
supply, and to sovereign tasks . This distinction is import -
ant because it determines whether and for what precisely 
a particular technology is absolutely indispensable, and 
whether there may be functional substitutes that elimi -
nate dependence on a specific technology.  The third step is to define the appropriate spatial-political 
system boundaries  within which technology sovereignty 
should be achieved. The degree of economic and political 
interdependence determines the security of supply  as 
well as the degree of dependency on actors outside the 
system. For Germany, this frame of reference should in 
principle  be the EU in view of the manifold existing 
economic, institutional, and political interdependencies. 
 In the final step, we consider the factors needed to 
produce technology sovereignty . We distinguish here 
between:
 already existing own  competencies and resources or 
the possibility to develop  the necessary competencies 
and resources ourselves if needed, and 
 access  to resources, competencies, and upstream 
services of third parties ( security of supply ). 
Constraints on technology sovereignty are to be feared if 
there is no security of supply from third parties for those 
 
4  |  5critical resources or competencies that a state or a federation 
of states cannot provide or develop itself.
The joint analysis of these dimensions can determine the 
current and the desirable degree of technology sovereignty in a given situation and, where needed, strategies can be 
developed to preserve or to generate technology sovereignty. 
A systemic perspective must always be taken here in order to 
comprehensively assess and develop both resilience to shocks 
and adaptability in a dynamic global environment.
Methods and data sources
A series of analytical steps are needed to develop strategies 
to preserve or produce technology sovereignty. Our position 
paper presents various methods and data sources for these 
steps. To gain a better understanding of our own compe -
tencies and resources , the methods range from patent and 
publication analyses through analyses of standardization 
activities to trade statistics grouped and analyzed by tech -
nology. Concerning the  dependence on other countries  or 
access to the resources and competencies of other countries, 
the analyses include data sources such as technology-specific trade statistics, complexity indices to identify value chains, 
and information about the governance behavior of countries 
based, for instance, on WTO compliance analyses or the 
World Governance index. 
We use two case examples in our position paper – 5G tech -
nologies, and Industry 4.0 / robotics – to illustrate how the 
concept can be applied and used to define modified strate -
gies that go beyond the current debate.

How can technology sovereignty be 
produced and preserved?
Strategic recommendations
The position paper’s first general recommended strategy is to 
provide the competencies  for the complex analysis to deter -
mine the necessity of technology sovereignty and to develop 
the necessary methods . This is a prerequisite to developing 
modified strategies to produce and preserve technology 
sovereignty. It must remain clear at all times that technology 
sovereignty is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for 
innovations  which ensure economic competitiveness and 
that society’s needs are met. The consideration of technology 
sovereignty must supplement and cannot replace what is 
required of a future-oriented innovation policy.
The concrete recommended strategies comprise a number of 
actions:
 Sufficiently broad investments in research and develop -
ment  are the basic prerequisite for establishing sover -
eignty in critical technologies now and in the future. Any 
reduction of existing R&D competencies that are currently 
used or could easily be mobilized in areas where there is a 
threat of dependence on third parties should be avoided.  International research cooperation and technology 
partnerships  are an important instrument for mobilizing 
complementary competencies and achieving technology 
interdependence with other selected countries by means 
of knowledge interdependencies, thus reducing one-sided 
dependency on third parties.  
 Actively  influencing standards  to direct international 
markets towards our own technologies as well as patent 
pools or Open Source software and hardware which pre -
vent monopolization and thus structural dependencies. 
 Creating  regulatory framework conditions  in critical tech -
nology fields that  foster innovation and production . 
 Promoting  innovation-oriented procurement that pro -
vides our own companies with the necessary incentives to 
invest in critical technologies. 
 Strengthening international organizations such as the 
WTO to ensure compliance with agreed multilateral  
 
6  |  7regulations as much as possible despite global trade 
conflicts. This is important since, in addition to the single 
European market, free world trade with its strong compe -
tition incentives remains an important boundary condition 
for technology sovereignty.
The concept of technology sovereignty is also congruent with 
increased investment in the resilience of the EU’s economic 
and social systems so that these can recover rapidly from 
shocks and disruptions, and adapt quickly to changing con -
texts. This is an important cornerstone of any consideration 
of future-proof technology sovereignty. The EU states already 
have the right prerequisites for this as their economies are strongly oriented towards open competition, and their societ -
ies are influenced by subsidiarity and, above all, are demo -
cratically organized. All this means the EU’s ability to adapt 
is fed by a diverse pool of economic, political, scientific, and 
civil society resources. Fostering the broadest possible basis 
of competencies and capacities in critical technology fields is 
an important element in lowering the vulnerability of the EU 
to potential disruptions and shocks – especially in times of 
increasing global uncertainty. In line with a systemic approach 
to resilience, key technological abilities should therefore be 
promoted, innovation networks built, and experimental learn -
ing enabled, for example, in regulatory sandboxes.
 

 
8  |  9Introduction  
During the course of the coronavirus crisis, it has been increasingly pointed out 
that a country needs to be able to provide its population with essential supplies 
using its own domestic capacities in order to avoid dependencies on other coun -
tries. It is argued that, in the event of a crisis, states or federations of states must 
be able to provide or produce in their own countries the infrastructures, services 
and products, e.g. medicines, needed for society and the economy and for carry -
ing out their own public tasks, and must have the appropriate technologies and 
sufficient research capacities for innovative solutions.  
This aspiration is linked to a demand that was already 
experiencing a renaissance in the EU and in Germany even before the corona crisis, namely to actively expand one’s own 
technology sovereignty. 
We define technology sovereignty as the ability of a state or a federation of  
states to provide the technologies it deems critical for welfare, competitiveness, 
and its ability to act, and to be able to develop these or source them from other 
economic areas without one-sided structural dependency.
The discussion about technology sovereignty at European lev -
el is determining the debate both in terms of the priorities in 
the new Framework Programme, as well as European industry 
and digital strategies. In addition, it forms a key component 
of the discussion on how to overcome the corona crisis in  
Europe.1 Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy 
Peter Altmaier and industry associations2 have put technology 
sovereignty (back) on the agenda in the context of Germany’s 
industrial strategy as well. At present, the most intensive dis -
cussions about sovereignty are taking place in the technology 
fields of vaccine development, 5G technology infrastructure, 
and artificial intelligence.3 These are considered critical tech -
nologies that not only generate huge markets for themselves 
worldwide, but also act as key technologies for almost all 
industrial and service sectors. They are pivotal to fulfilling sov -
ereign tasks in terms of providing public services such as civil 
security, healthcare, energy, and transport infrastructures. In 
view of the current coronavirus pandemic, this also concerns 
mobilizing sufficient research capacities and generating tech -
nologies at home, in order to be able to contain the spread and impacts of the virus using protective measures, innova -
tive treatments, and medication. Here, it is essential to have 
technologies available to maintain important economic and 
social activities that are restricted by the virus. 
However, the concepts and interpretations of technology sov -
ereignty vary depending on economic and political interests. 
In order to support (innovation) policy, a more differentiated 
analysis is required of the area of potential conflict between 
global trade, integrated value chains and technology and 
knowledge transfer on the one hand, and the need for state 
sovereignty on the other. 
With this position paper, we would like to provide a con -
ceptual basis for the debate and offer an invitation to an 
informed dialogue. We argue that, in view of global chal -
lenges such as climate change or pandemics, closely inter -
connected value chains, and geopolitical uncertainties, only a 
consistently European perspective of technology sovereignty 
is future-proof. The integration of value added in the Euro -
 
www.isi.fraunhofer.depean single market and the positioning vis-à-vis the increas -
ingly protectionist USA and China makes the national level 
within the EU appear insufficient, even counterproductive for 
producing technology sovereignty, if only because of the size 
differences. 
Our concept of technology sovereignty is characterized by a 
degree of differentiation that goes beyond the current often 
politically driven discussion. We place technology sovereignty 
in the wider context of economic and innovation sovereign -
ty. In addition, we distinguish the various functions that technologies fulfill in government, society, and the economy 
and, based on this, propose criteria and methods able to 
determine the need for and degree of European sovereignty 
in terms of key technologies. We formulate recommended 
strategies to avoid one-sided dependencies in technologies 
classified as critical and to strengthen the resilience of EU 
member states to external shocks. We illustrate our concept 
using two case examples – 5G technologies and Industry 4.0 /  
robotics – before we close the paper by summarizing several 
core statements.

10  |  11What is technology sovereignty?
At its core, the term technology sovereignty describes the ability to generate  
scientific-technological knowledge either autonomously or to be able to access 
such in stable partnerships without constraints. Technology sovereignty does not 
imply comprehensive technology autarky that calls into question the international 
division of labor or globalization and strives to provide every technology classified 
as critical. Primarily, it describes preserving options by developing and maintain -
ing own capabilities and avoiding one-sided dependencies.
To start with, the concept of technology sovereignty must be 
distinguished from the broader concepts of innovation sover -
eignty and economic sovereignty (see Figure 1): 
We can describe economic sovereignty as the ability to 
generate value added and prosperity through independent 
activities or through a mutual exchange with other economic 
regions without becoming unilaterally dependent on external 
actors. In a similar way, this applies to the original sovereign 
tasks and to the independent provision of public services 
by both private and state actors. Economic sovereignty and 
sovereignty in performing public tasks are traditionally based 
on the need for unimpeded access to natural resources and 
capital by relevant actors and unimpeded access to technolo -
gies, innovations, competencies, and data.In the efforts made by economic, innovation and technology 
policies to establish economic sovereignty, there is a growing 
interest in technology sovereignty alongside the exploitation 
of raw materials and the advantageous positioning of eco -
nomic actors in global production and value chains.4
Technology sovereignty plays a special role in the bigger 
picture of state sovereignty, because it enables economic sov -
ereignty and autonomous state actions over and over again, 
and because it is in itself renewable, in contrast to resource 
stocks, for example. 
In modern, globally networked economies, value creation and 
welfare as well as guaranteeing public services are based on 
innovations being generated and widely applied. Innovations, 
Figure 1: Technology sovereignty as part of innovation and economic sovereignty
 
www.isi.fraunhofer.dein turn, depend on being able to generate the technolog -
ical basis for current and future economic activities locally 
(scientific- technological competencies and qualifications) or 
to obtain these from reliable partners (application compe -
tence). 
However, scientific-technological competencies on their own 
have no effect and are without relevance for the innovation 
sovereignty of Germany and the EU unless the abilities need -
ed to exploit technological insights are also available, and 
the necessary system prerequisites exist, such as the required 
infrastructures, production capacities, regulatory framework 
conditions etc. 
Technology sovereignty is therefore a necessary, but by no 
means sufficient basis for achieving innovation sovereignty. In turn, such innovation sovereignty is indispensable, but not 
sufficient for achieving wider-ranging economic sovereignty. 
This applies equally to the sovereignty in guaranteeing public 
services that also depends on other criteria such as access to 
competencies, capital and resources (see Figure 1).
The concept of technology sovereignty introduced here does 
not aim at a general expansion of technological activities 
in fields in which our own international competitiveness is 
perceived as too low or as capable of being developed. While, 
from a state’s perspective, efforts are often made to achieve 
technological competitiveness  in as many fields as possible, 
the search for technology sovereignty  is usually in selected 
fields that are considered particularly important according to 
criteria that will be defined in the following subsection.5
Technology functions and rationales
Three functions of technologies can be differentiated to de -
termine when a technology is classified as critical for a state 
or a federation of states (see Table 1):
 Safeguarding the original sovereign tasks  that govern -
ment bodies perform by using the available technologies 
(e.g. civil security, defense, administration).
 Meeting the needs of society  (e.g. food, shelter, energy 
and water, mobility, communications, health): on the one 
hand, satisfying basic social needs through public services 
such as healthcare or supplying – partially critical – infra -
structures. On the other hand, in regard to changes that 
are mainly initiated and controlled by government, such 
as targeted socio-technical transformations (e.g. the ener -
gy transition, transformation of mobility). 
 Ensuring the medium and long-term success of a national 
economy and its technological competitiveness , which is 
mainly supported by private actors, although this can be 
substantially shaped by state support and financing. Legitimate reasons to pursue technology sovereignty result 
from all three functions. While the state’s ability to act in the 
domain of original sovereign tasks constitutes the most direct 
representation of the necessity for technology sovereignty, 
meeting the needs of society and technological competitive -
ness are also dependent on the unimpeded access of the 
actors of a state of a federation of states to a broad portfolio 
of technologies and development competencies.
The transition between these three bundles of functions and 
rationales is fluid and often not sharply delineated. Techno -
logical competencies that represent options today and are 
therefore more relevant for technological competitiveness can 
become fundamental for the fulfillment of social needs and 
sovereign tasks in the short term. Nevertheless, separating 
these rationales is useful – if not essential – to establish a 
convincing context for political justification.

Static, dynamic, and reactive technology sovereignty
Different goals for producing or preserving technology sover -
eignty can therefore be distinguished in addition to the above 
described differentiation of the rationales (see Table 1):
 Preserving or protecting current technology sovereignty , 
with the goal:
 of obtaining an advantageous position  in global in -
novation and value creation chains and guaranteeing 
state sovereign functions and public services  based on 
existing competencies and resources, 
 of managing crises using own resources and thus 
ensuring that the European economic and innovation 
system is crisis-proof  (resilient). This resilience and 
adaptability to foreseeable and unforeseen disruptions 
and crises is becoming increasingly important for European societies in view of developments that are 
perceived as dangerous. The risk of system failures is 
also becoming more and more relevant with the grow -
ing dependency on increasingly complex technical 
systems, for example, power supply or IT networks. In 
addition, natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, 
the increasing prevalence of floods and droughts due 
to climate change, pandemics, or protectionist and ag -
gressive trade policy developments in the international 
political environment pose increasing threats to the 
economy and society.  
 Dynamic development of technology sovereignty , with 
the goal of assuming an active, formative role in evolving 
processes and development pathways to proactively shape 
future developments.
 

 
14  |  15Criteria to determine the importance 
of technologies and access to them
Importance and types of criteria 
Empirically determining to what extent technology sovereign -
ty exists for a specific state or federation of states and a spe -
cific technology (country-technology combination) requires 
the analysis of two interconnected questions:  
1) Within which system boundaries is technology sover -
eignty aspired to?
2) What are the factors influencing technology sov -
ereignty and how are they expressed in a concrete 
case?Analyzing the system boundaries (question 1) is an important 
step to understanding whether a certain technology requires 
more detailed consideration and perhaps political measures 
to ensure technology sovereignty.  It is necessary to define cri -
teria to assess the technological, economic, legal, institution -
al, and political framework conditions. An in-depth analysis 
of the degree of technological sovereignty is only necessary 
for those technologies classified as critical after analyzing the 
system boundaries (question 2). 
Criteria for system boundaries
Three different dimensions  can be distinguished in the discus -
sion of system boundaries:
 the spatial-political  dimension, i.e. the geographical and 
political frame of reference for technology sovereignty,
 the functional  dimension of the analyzed services or 
goods for which technology sovereignty is to be aimed at 
in principle, and which we differentiated into sovereign 
tasks, social needs, and economic competitiveness in the 
first step above, 
 the time dimension, which distinguishes short-term supply 
bottlenecks from structural dependencies.
Three additional sub-criteria are applied when determining 
the spatial-political area  to which technology sovereignty 
should apply:  The degree of political integration: As a rule, the more 
advanced this is, the more institutionalized coordination 
mechanisms are that aim at a free exchange of technolo -
gies. 
 The degree of economic integration: The more advanced 
this is, for instance, with regard to value chains or corpo -
rate ownership / control, the less likely and even impossible 
it becomes to decouple individual political-geographical 
areas. 
 Shared culture and value set: If, for example, an economic 
region shares the model of an open society or has social 
and political common ground such as a democratic state 
constitution with the separation of powers, the likelihood 
tends to be low that individual actors will deliberately use 
dependencies to reduce the technology sovereignty of 
other actors.
 
www.isi.fraunhofer.deWhereas the temporal and functional dimensions should 
be analyzed and decided on a case by case basis, a general 
estimation can be made for the spatial-geographic dimension 
of Germany: its spatial-political integration within the EU is 
particularly strong. There are clear rules with the single mar -
ket. In addition, there are numerous competencies regarding 
foreign trade issues at EU level. This degree of political inte -
gration makes politically induced disruptions to value chains 
and knowledge flows seem very unlikely. Mutual economic 
interdependencies and the European countries’ common 
sociopolitical model also favor the “EU” political level. This 
is all the more valid since a national frame of reference for 
technology sovereignty would create its own necessity, as 
corresponding national efforts would undermine confidence 
in the interdependencies and mutual obligations within the 
EU. This would contribute to a dynamic of renationalization 
that cannot be in the interests of the technology sovereignty 
of the member states as a whole. However, such an approach 
could and should be adaptable to any changes in the level of 
interdependencies within the EU over time. 
Starting from the EU as the region of analysis, the criticality 
of access to technologies outside the EU is assessed. This is 
indicated by the frequency and intensity of trade conflicts and 
violations of WTO rules by individual countries. Another indi -
cation is the existence of trade agreements, as these guaran -
tee a certain degree of stability in economic and knowledge 
relations. Especially the existence of bilateral trade agree -
ments with countries that have similar cultural, socio-political, 
or economic models (e.g. Canada or Japan) could result in 
otherwise essential technologies being classified as less prob -lematic. Access here would be ensured with a certain degree 
of reliability. 
We refer to the categories introduced in the chapter “Tech -
nology functions and rationales” for technology sovereignty 
aimed at supplying the following functional areas :
 technologies for maintaining the original sovereign  
functions of a state,  
 ensuring public services , 
 ensuring the medium and long-term success of a national 
economy and its technological competitiveness .
Criteria along the time dimension are needed to distinguish 
short-term supply and delivery bottlenecks from those related 
to structural technology sovereignty. For example, in the con -
text of the corona crisis, short-term delivery problems for cer -
tain goods like face masks or toilet paper were also addressed 
as dependency problems. We believe a demarcation is needed 
here. In terms of our concept, technology sovereignty refers 
to at least a medium time horizon (e.g. six months to ten 
years). Shorter-term dependencies can be counteracted, e.g. 
by improved stock-keeping. In a very long-term perspective, 
numerous new technological competencies can be devel -
oped; on the other hand, there is the risk of medium-term 
dependencies becoming locked in if path dependencies exist, 
which can then only be addressed by accepting extremely 
high conversion costs.
Criteria to determine the degree of technology sovereignty
For the criteria to determine the degree of technology sover -
eignty , a distinction must be made between various sub-crite -
ria that influence technology sovereignty in different ways:
 Technology sovereignty is high if the technology is 
produced within a country’s own political-geographical 
domain, or the ability to produce it exists. 
 In cases where technologies are not produced in a 
country’s own political-geographical domain, but can 
be obtained without restriction from outside it, factors 
should be considered that increase the risk of access to the technologies being limited or refused. Corresponding 
factors are required that describe these supply risks.
 Supply risks are reduced if technological alternatives (sub -
stitutes) are available. These also have a disciplinary effect 
on the exertion of market power by a supply concentra -
tion. The existence of mutual dependencies has a similar 
effect.
 
16  |  17Ability to produce the technology in the 
home country
If a technology is already produced in the home country, it 
can usually be assumed that it will also be available locally in 
the future. However, even in this case, the condition must be 
satisfied that the required components remain available and 
that access to critical input factors continues to be given. This 
makes it clear that assessing technology sovereignty may not 
be limited to the final product alone, but must consider the 
entire associated value chain.
A high degree of technology sovereignty exists even if initially 
only the abilities to start production in the short to medium 
term are available. The ability to produce a certain technolo -
gy presupposes knowledge and access to other critical input 
factors. 
Technological know-how can be mapped using, e.g. technol -
ogy-specific patent indicators that show technological perfor -
mance (see Infobox). However, this also requires the existence 
of economic actors who can apply this knowledge. Ultimate -
ly, any assessment of ability also necessitates assessing the 
performance of the corresponding technological innovation 
system. 
Criteria for supply risks for technologies  
obtained from abroad 
For cases in which the relevant technologies are only available 
outside the analyzed geographical-political area, factors must 
be considered that increase the risk that the technology can 
no longer be accessed for economic, political, or other reasons 
(e.g. climate events, political instability, pandemics). 
This risk of access restrictions increases with increasing sup -
plier concentration, because this raises their market power on 
the one hand, and reduces the scope for switching to other 
supplier countries should access be restricted. To estimate 
the risk of losing access to resources and technologies, it is 
important to regularly analyze indicators such as, e.g. the 
Herfindahl Hirschman index, which can be used to measure 
this kind of supplier concentration.
In addition to supply concentration, the reliability of the sup -
plier countries also plays an important role. Important factors 
here include political and social stability, compliance with legal 
regulations, and the absence of corruption. For example, the EU assesses countries supplying critical raw materials with the 
help of the World Governance Indicator and the underlying 
database of the World Bank.6 The degree of mutual depen -
dency must also be examined. Mutual dependency exists 
to the extent to which a supplier is itself dependent on the 
country it refuses to supply. This reduces the risk of one-sided, 
deliberate supply restrictions. Trade statistics on the flow of 
goods, an analysis of the compliance of individual countries 
with WTO regulations or the Economic Complexity Index7 on 
production capacities can provide important information here.
Existence of possible substitutes 
Supply risks are reduced and technology sovereignty increas -
es if technological alternatives (substitutes) to the analyzed 
technology are available or foreseeable.   
Technological feasibility is one criterion for the existence of a 
substitution alternative. In this context, the first thing is to as -
sess whether there are any relevant approaches in the home 
country in the medium term. Patent analyses and periodical, 
systematic expert surveys can provide indications of this. This 
includes assessing whether the relevant possibilities make 
economic sense. Finally, it is essential that substitutes are 
also potentially available or must be created within the home 
country.  Ultimately, this means that the above listed criteria 
must then also be applied to the substitution options.
Criteria to assess technology sovereignty
Overall, it becomes clear that several criteria need to be 
combined to assess the degree of technology sovereignty. 
These include quantitative indicators and evaluations based 
on qualitative estimates. The assessment generally follows 
a continuum of a stronger or weaker degree of technology 
sovereignty rather than a simple yes-no decision. At the same 
time, the different sub-aspects make it clear that assessments 
may change over time. In this respect, technology sovereignty 
is not a static construct, but a dynamic one.  The fact that the 
granularity of analysis and the indicators used to implement 
the criteria can vary is shown by the discussion of two differ -
ent example applications (see page 25 ff.).
 
www.isi.fraunhofer.deInfobox: Analytical tools for assessing technology sovereigntySummary of several important methods for analyzing technology  
sovereignty
Analyzing to what degree technology sovereignty exists requires a mix of methods. Quantitative indicators based 
on technology-specific search algorithms aid these kinds of analyses. They should be supported by systematic 
expert surveys to provide context and validation so that the specificity of each individual technology can be con-
sidered.
Own competencies and resources
 Patent analyses  and derived indicators such as patent shares and specialization map the extent of a state’s or a 
federation of states’ own technology competencies. 
 Bibliometric analyses  and derived indicators such as publication shares and specialization provide information 
about the scientific resources and competencies of a state or a federation of states.
 Analyses of the contribution of individual countries to global or – leading – national standards , possibly in 
the context of their own patent portfolio, enable an estimation of the autonomy of a state or a federation of 
states in shaping future technology development.
 Analyses of technology- and resource-specific production statistics  enable the identification of the regional 
availability of relevant resources and production capacities.
 Analyses of technology-specific export shares  provide information about the international competitiveness of 
the production of a state or a federation of states. 
Dependence and access to competencies and resources
 Analyses of international standards, patent pools and Open Source repositories provide information about 
internationally available technologies that can be used. 
 Analyses of trade balances grouped and analyzed by technology  provide information about the dependence 
of a state or a federation of states on technology-specific imports (resources and components), and their 
distribution. 
 Complexity indices  make it possible to estimate the dependence of relevant geographical areas on specific 
technologies and how these technologies are integrated into local or regional innovation and value chains.
 Analyses, e.g. of WTO compliance , enable a concrete assessment of the reliability of potential partner nations 
in specific issues.  
 Analyses of the World Bank’s World Governance Index, various corruption indices and indices on the form of 
governance make it possible to assess the basic reliability of potential partner nations.
Finally, the results of the individual analyses must be carefully weighed against each other in order to arrive at an 
overall assessment. 
 
18  |  19Strategies for dealing with challenges 
related to technology sovereignty
The above remarks show the numerous perspectives and differentiations that 
must be applied to determine the degree of technology sovereignty and to draw 
up counter strategies. These conceptual considerations lead to a series of poten -
tial strategic measures suitable for countering the challenges of technology sover -
eignty.
Analytical capability to determine the need for technology 
sovereignty
Analytical capabilities in the system form the basis for ad -
dressing the question of which technologies are critical and 
how to secure access to them. Methodological and analytical 
competencies must be available in order to be able to process 
the main dimensions with regard to technology sovereignty in 
a technology-specific manner and with the necessary granu -
larity. Sufficient competencies and databases are required to 
perform the following three-dimensional analysis: 
 determine the criticality of technologies, 
 develop a clear picture of which fundamental economic 
and social functions this technology helps to fulfill and 
how it does so, 
 ensure access and provide own competencies.
Possible strategic approaches 
The following strategic approaches can be derived from the 
three determining factors of technology sovereignty:
 For a country to maintain its own ability to produce the 
relevant technologies and products in a dynamically 
developing environment, it is first necessary to generate technology-specific knowledge using the classic instru -
ments of research and innovation policy. This requires a 
critical mass of knowledge carriers – persons possessing 
the relevant knowledge – which is only formed by actually 
teaching the corresponding content at universities (e.g. 
the gap in professorships in battery technology).
 In addition, public procurement can provide strategic 
impulses so that ultimately production capacities for tech -
nologies and the corresponding products can be created 
or ensured.
 However, the potential portfolio of technologies is much 
too large for the majority of national economies to 
provide the necessary research capacities in all the fields 
relevant for technology sovereignty. Further, these tech -
nologies or products often require access to certain raw 
materials. Therefore, a division of labor is necessary, not 
only in the European context, but in an international one, 
which can be initiated, for example, through long-term 
research cooperation. In such cooperation, bilateral, but 
above all multilateral research is conducted with partners 
who have the relevant complementary competencies in 
technologies identified as critical, which ensures joint 
access to these technologies and avoids one-sided depen -
dencies. 
 
www.isi.fraunhofer.de The development of open standards (potentially com -
bined with patent pools) supported by many international 
companies, but also by Open Source software and hard -
ware, can be regarded as a special form of access. These 
prevent a proprietary monopolization of technologies 
and therefore dependencies. These standards also reduce 
dependencies on single suppliers within complex value 
chains and therefore also reduce risks (e.g. standards in 
the automotive industry increase competition among 
suppliers). 
 If this is combined with public procurement, it allows 
access a larger number of suppliers of the relevant 
technologies. This enhances competition which prevents 
the dominating companies exerting market power and 
ensures sustainable competition. 
 In the long term, in addition to supporting research and 
demand-oriented strategies such as public procurement, 
it makes sense to design the regulatory framework in a 
way that gives domestic or European industries the right 
conditions and incentives to develop the corresponding 
research and therefore also production capacities in fields 
prospectively at risk of technology dependencies. This 
includes an appropriately designed competition policy, 
which includes the acquisition of European companies by 
non-European concerns.
 If technology sovereignty is limited or no longer present 
due to already existing dependencies on individual suppli -
ers, attempts can be made over the long term to build up 
a country’s own research competencies in order to develop 
substitutes. However, this is often not possible, even in 
the long term, due to resource restrictions. Furthermore, 
such dependencies usually affect not just one country’s economy but the majority of national economies. This is 
why joint solutions are an option here, coordinated by the 
European Union, but also by larger international consortia. 
 Finally, in addition to the single European market, free 
world trade with its strong incentives for competition 
remains an important boundary condition to ensure 
technology sovereignty. Compliance with agreed multi-
lateral regulations should be ensured by strengthening 
key international organizations such as the WTO.
Increasing the resilience of the EU
The EU should increase its investments in the resilience of its 
economic and social systems so that these can recover rapidly 
from shocks and disruptions, and adapt quickly to changing 
contexts. This is an important cornerstone of any consider -
ation of future-proof technology sovereignty. The EU states 
already have the right prerequisites for this because their 
economies are strongly oriented towards open competition. 
In addition, their societies are influenced by subsidiarity and, 
above all, are organized democratically. This means the EU’s 
adaptability is fed by a diverse pool of common economic, 
political, scientific, and civil society features.
Fostering a broad basis of competencies and capacities in 
critical technology fields is an important element in lowering 
the EU’s vulnerability to potential disruptions and shocks – 
especially in times of increasing global uncertainty. In the 
sense of a systemic approach to resilience, technological key 
capabilities should be promoted, innovation networks formed 
as well as experimental learning encouraged, for example, in 
the context of regulatory sandboxes.
 
20  |  21Examples of determining and ensuring technology sovereignty
How can we analyze whether technology sovereignty exists in concrete terms  
and what measures can be taken to ensure it? The following two case studies 
illustrate what such an analysis should look like.
Example 1: 5G technologies
System boundaries for technology sovereignty
The geographical and political frame of reference for 5G 
technologies is defined by the European area, based on the 
joint European decision for GSM in the early 1990s. It is 
therefore necessary to consider technology sovereignty for 5G 
within the context of a highly integrated system in political 
and economic terms. 5G is very important for both private 
sector and public sector functions; its economic and societal 
integration and environmental interdependence are high. 
When considering the shared European culture and set of 
values, which attach great importance to the free exchange 
of information, 5G technologies are very important as a 
necessary communication infrastructure. 5G technologies 
are therefore highly relevant for public services, safeguarding 
sovereign tasks and ensuring economic success in almost 
every industrial sector. Finally, the time dimension must be 
considered when analyzing 5G technologies. Providing the 
associated functions in the European area in the short term 
and long-term resilience are both essential conditions for the 
technology sovereignty of 5G.
Degree of technology sovereignty  
The analysis must begin by determining whether the Europe -
an area has the capability to supply these technologies, or at 
least the knowledge required for technology development. 
Patent applications are suitable indicators for identifying 
technology competence (see Infobox on page 20). A current 
analysis, conducted with the support of Fraunhofer ISI,8 
shows that the patents for 5G technologies are indeed 
strongly influenced by Chinese companies, but that Euro-
pean enterprises also feature among the internationally most 
active technology developers. At present, Chinese companies, 
especially Huawei and ZTE, account for 33 percent of total 
5G patents worldwide, South Korean enterprises for 27 per -
cent, European companies for 17 percent, and US-American 
companies for 14 percent.Nokia and Ericsson are two of the internationally leading 
manufacturers of 5G network components from Europe. 
Compared to 4G technologies, both companies have 
increased their patent shares in 5G technologies (Nokia by 
2.39, Ericsson by 1.14 percentage points).9 In addition, small 
and medium-sized enterprises that do not receive much 
attention, such as Adva Optical Networking from Germany, 
continue to be active as 5G network equipment providers.10 
Intensive efforts are being made in Europe to expand the 
knowledge base for 5G. The European Graphene Flagship11 
is one example of this. Optoelectronic components are being 
developed here that enable the extremely high switching 
speeds needed for 5G.12
In principle, therefore, there are at least two important ele -
ments for achieving technology sovereignty in EU countries: 
the technological production base with internationally lead -
ing technology companies, and a dynamic knowledge base. 
It cannot be stated in principle, therefore, that a one-sided 
dependency exists on technologies and know-how developed 
in China.
What is the supply risk? 
The discussion usually focuses on Huawei as the world market 
leader for 5G components. As already pointed out, however, 
there are at least several potential suppliers in Europe, who 
are among the world’s leading 5G suppliers. But other global 
regions also offer possibilities, especially South Korea and 
the US. With 13 percent and 11 percent of all 5G patents, 
Samsung, and LG Electronics (South Korea) are among the 
top five companies worldwide. Samsung is ranked second13 
after Huawei (15 percent). Major companies in the US include 
Qualcomm (6 percent patent share) and Intel (4 percent);  
CISCO is also expected to become a major player in future.14 
A differentiated view of the supply risk is therefore required.  
 
www.isi.fraunhofer.deIn the short term and also from a cost perspective, Huawei is 
the most important 5G supplier. However, alternatives already 
exist in Europe with Ericsson and Nokia. This is also shown 
by the example of the British Vodafone concern, which 
announced at the beginning of 2020 that it would swap 
Huawei hardware for Nokia components in security-relevant 
areas of its 5G network.15 However, Vodafone expects addi -
tional costs of around 200 million euros and a possible delay 
of two to five years for the switch. Furthermore, both South 
Korea and the US reduce the supply risk with several potential 
suppliers. Both regions are ranked higher in the World Gover -
nance Index than China; the US is ahead of South Korea (but 
somewhat behind Germany).16 At the same time, the EU has 
struck a trade deal with South Korea, which has a positive 
effect on assessing its reliability as a supplier country. 
Are there possible substitutes? 
Intensive work on technological alternatives for individual 
components of 5G technologies is already ongoing within 
the EU. This concerns the required materials and switching 
elements in particular.17 Europe is one of the leading innova -
tion regions in the field of materials. Optimized materials can, 
among other things, help to improve the energy efficiency 
of 5G technologies and thus address an important technolo-
gical challenge. Ericsson and Nokia are part of the relevant 
research networks, especially the Graphene Flagship, and 
therefore have direct access to these globally leading tech-
nology developments in contrast to competing 5G suppliers 
from China, South Korea, and the US.
Overall, the analysis shows:  
 Focusing the discussion about technology sovereignty for 
5G on the role of Huawei and the dependency on China 
is too narrow. 
 In fact, applying the criteria to determine technology 
sovereignty reveals that several aspects already speak for technology sovereignty for 5G in the European area, or 
that at least the potentials for this already exist. 
 This differentiated view of technology sovereignty for 
5G puts the discussion for the development of suitable 
strategies for dealing with technology sovereignty on a 
wider footing.  
What are the possible strategies for dealing with  
technology sovereignty?
With regard to 5G in Europe, our analysis reveals that tech -
nology sovereignty has multiple layers, can be described ana -
lytically from different perspectives, and which issues should 
be subject to closer examination. This results in a more com -
prehensive picture that can stimulate the discussion of further 
strategic options for dealing with technology sovereignty.  
In the short term, it makes sense to expand supply relation -
ships with the European 5G suppliers, and explore setting 
up further supply relationships with leading companies from 
South Korea and the US in order to reduce the overall con -
centration in supply chains. 
Developing a European innovation eco-system would be 
one way to provide reliable and configurable 5G technolo -
gies within the EU in the medium term. This means that the 
individual competencies, potentials, and technologies that 
already exist today, together with the required framework 
conditions such as European standardization, would have to 
be combined into an overall system. This would be supported 
by different stakeholders from industry, research, politics, and 
society, who perform different functions in the systems. Key 
actors at company level would be the network equipment 
suppliers Ericsson and Nokia. They could form the crystal -
lization points of this innovation network. Close relations 
and dependencies within this network would simultaneously 
make it more robust.
 
22  |  23Example 2: Industry 4.0 and robotics
System boundaries for technology sovereignty 
The EU forms the geographical and political frame of refer -
ence for Industry 4.0 and robotics, since these technology 
fields represent key unique selling points of leading Europe -
an countries in a global comparison. However, since not all 
European countries have the relevant competencies, discus -
sions here also always have a national component. Some 
member states have only low competencies in this field, and 
the density of industrial robots in Europe as a whole is below 
that of China.18 Still, there are relevant competencies within 
the scope of European institutions and thus at the core of 
Europe’s innovation and industry policy.
In addition, it can be stated that the contribution of tech-
nology sovereignty to prosperity and value creation in Indus -
try 4.0 and robotics is mainly realized in the context of global 
markets. Although Germany was the country with the third 
highest density of industrial robots after Singapore and South 
Korea in 2018, the German market is only about one sixth 
the size of the Chinese one and approximately half the size of 
the Japanese market. With Germany, Denmark, Italy, France, 
Austria, Sweden, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Finland, 
numerous member states are net exporters of robotics, whose 
technological design capability can be implemented globally, 
especially compared to countries that (still) have to import 
complete robots or their core components to a large extent, 
and source these partially from Europe, and partially from 
suppliers outside Europe.19 
Degree of technology sovereignty  
Almost without exception, Europe’s major industrial nations 
have a significantly above-average technology sovereignty in 
this field, which can be documented along various analytical 
dimensions – from patents through to exports. Nevertheless, 
there is still a considerable dependence on non-European 
producers with regard to key intermediate inputs in the field 
of microelectronics. However, since both the final product and 
the direct upstream components are still designed and manu -
factured in Europe, the main objective of the innovation and 
industry policy debates in this context is the question of how 
to preserve or use existing competencies.
The success of many European nations in the field of advanced 
manufacturing and especially robotics is based on systemically 
combining strengths in mechanical and plant engineering with software and hardware for integrated systems. Europe’s key 
challenges and its major contributions to solutions are current -
ly in managing complex industrial application scenarios while 
guaranteeing the security of networked systems. In terms of 
IT, various European companies are developing successful ref -
erence architectures and making major contributions to global 
standardization and thus to achieving interoperability.
What is the supply risk?
There is a supply risk in particular with regard to key hard -
ware components required in the production of Industry 4.0 
and robotic devices. The corresponding chips and micro -
electronic elements are not only no longer manufactured in 
Europe, but are also only partially designed here. As a result, 
Europe is already clearly dependent today on external supply 
chains for major components and partially also on specific 
manufacturing skills. For example, there are only two relevant 
production sites for microchips left in Europe, so that a mul -
titude of basic components now have to be imported, mainly 
from Asian countries.
In the medium term, as the technology evolves, it is conceiv -
able that larger shares of value creation will shift to software 
or hardware components that have not been produced in 
Europe for some time, which could lead to increased depen-
dency on a few large technology companies in the United 
States or Asia. Although there is not (yet) any isolated de -
pendency on individual non-European states or companies at 
present, greater concentration is conceivable in the future.
Are there possible substitutes? 
Technologies from the field of robotics represent a pivotal 
component of modern manufacturing systems and cannot be 
substituted by other technologies from a systemic perspec -
tive. 
However, European companies have already positioned 
themselves in specific, higher-value areas of robotics (complex 
application scenarios, guaranteeing security), where they 
are confident and profitable actors thanks to the strength of 
their existing competencies. To a certain extent, therefore, it 
should be possible to resubstitute simpler, currently imported 
technologies with corresponding European products should 
such a switch be required for geopolitical reasons.
 
www.isi.fraunhofer.deOverall, the analysis shows:  
 The economic advantage of existing technology sover -
eignty is usually only (fully) realizable in a global context; 
it would be a drawback if development perspectives were 
restricted to certain markets; interoperability remains a 
major goal. 
 An already existing dependency in the field of major com -
ponents could become more significant in future if these 
components (microelectronics) themselves become more 
relevant; stronger and more one-sided dependencies are 
possible. 
 If core competencies are drained, e.g. due to company ac -
quisitions, there is a danger that key unique selling points 
will be lost to those demanding specifically European 
competencies.  
 Ongoing technology development means that even lead -
ing companies with high integration competence face the 
challenge of learning new skills in fields that will become 
more important.
 A crucial point in this context is to consider to what extent 
technology sovereignty must be regained in important 
complementary areas such as cloud and data infrastruc -
tures.
What are the possible strategies for dealing with  
technology sovereignty?
Substantial investments in retaining and updating current 
and future key competencies in the field of Industry 4.0 
and robotics can be observed in many European countries. 
Increasingly, other countries that want to overcome their 
current dependency on imports are also making efforts to 
master these skills (and will do so in the medium term).
Government support here often takes place nationally and at 
European level through the Research Framework Programmes and initiatives for “Advanced industrial technologies”. These 
include the targeted funding of technological developments 
on the one hand, but also preventing the strategic acqui -
sition of existing expertise by non-European companies or 
nations on the other hand. In addition, funding (research) 
cluster initiatives and other alliances is intended to increase 
cooperation between science and industry and therefore the 
efficiency and speed of technology transfer – and by using 
test beds – to not forfeit technological leadership in complex 
application contexts. Finally, individual member states and 
numerous European institutions are supporting the participa -
tion in international standards. This is intended to ensure that 
existing competencies and those still to be developed can be 
productively integrated into the global value networks of the 
future, and to guarantee the highest possible interoperability 
for European system solutions. There are additional activities 
to create new basic data infrastructures such as GAIA-X, 
in which European solutions can be integrated securely, 
efficiently and without being directly dependent on external 
providers, where this is necessary to guarantee data security.
A multi-level strategy is therefore suitable for the future:
 Anticipate technology developments and develop the 
associated required capacities,
 strengthen and update existing key competencies,
 create a systemic framework (cloud and data infrastruc -
ture), within which specifically European competencies 
can be further developed,
 avoid that key competencies that set European companies 
apart from international competitors are drained through 
external acquisitions,
 deliberately spread the supply risk in upstream areas 
where it does not make sense to develop own competen -
cies.
 
24  |  25Conclusions
Global prosperity is built on an international division of labor in terms of indus -
tries and technologies, globally-oriented open trade policies, and science net -
works that span national borders. 
At the same time, there is an understandable need for coun -
tries to preserve or to create a politically autonomous scope 
of action with the lowest possible structural dependency on 
competitors with regard to critical technologies, in order to 
keep their own economies competitive in the long term and 
to be able to meet society’s essential needs. The calls for 
technology sovereignty, which are becoming louder and loud -
er, intensified by the current crises and geopolitical shifts, are 
therefore in conflict with a globally networked economy as a 
guarantor of prosperity, especially for Europe and Germany.   
Against this background, our concept provides added value 
through its differentiated view of technology sovereignty 
and concrete proposals for its analysis. This differentiation is 
based on the current and future criticality of technologies, 
the motivation for technology sovereignty, and the basis for 
producing it, i.e. essentially the access to current and poten -
tial resources and competencies (see Figure 2). The interplay 
of these dimensions can determine the current and desirable 
degree of technology sovereignty in a specific situation and, 
where required, strategies can be developed to preserve or 
produce it.Comprehensive analytical system capacities are required to 
decide which technologies are critical or will be in future, 
what the key factors are that make technology sovereignty 
in our defined sense possible, and what measures should be 
taken at which level to achieve this. At the same time, this 
must also consider the system conditions that determine how 
technologies are transformed into functioning innovations 
on markets, such as production capacities, infrastructures, or 
demand-side conditions. Finally, it requires strategic creativity 
and foresight to avoid throwing out the baby of Germany’s 
and the EU’s internationally oriented competitiveness with 
the bathwater of technology sovereignty. For Germany, given 
the extent of economic and political interdependence and 
the added value this provides through specialization gains 
and political stability, the frame of reference for technology 
sovereignty is definitely the EU. A renationalization reflex in 
the face of striving for technology sovereignty would not only 
be inefficient, but even counterproductive in the long run, 
as it would trigger a spiral of protectionism. A system that 
differentiates the challenge posed by technology sovereignty, 
analyzes and processes this in a forward-looking manner, will 
not only be more adaptable in future, and therefore more 
competitive, but also more resilient to external shocks.
