Global attributes




























Global attributes




Global attributes
 are attributes common to all HTML elements; they can be used on all elements, though they may have no effect on some elements.


Global attributes may be specified on all 
HTML elements
, 
even those not specified in the standard
. That means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though using those elements means that the document is no longer HTML5-compliant. For example, HTML5-compliant browsers hide content marked as 
<foo hidden>â¦</foo>
, even though 
<foo>
 is not a valid HTML element.


In addition to the basic HTML global attributes, the following global attributes also exist:




xml:lang
 and 
xml:base
 â these are inherited from the XHTML specifications and deprecated, but kept for compatibility purposes.


The ARIA 
role
 attribute and the multiple 
aria-*
 states and properties, used for ensuring accessibility.


The 
event handler attributes
 listed below.

List of global attributes




accesskey




Provides a hint for generating a keyboard shortcut for the current element. This attribute consists of a space-separated list of characters. The browser should use the first one that exists on the computer keyboard layout.




anchor
 


Non-standard






Associates a positioned element with an anchor element. The attribute's value is the 
id
 value of the element you want to anchor the positioned element to. The element can then be positioned 
using CSS anchor positioning
.




autocapitalize




Controls whether inputted text is automatically capitalized and, if so, in what manner.




autocorrect




Controls whether input text is automatically corrected for spelling errors.
This can be applied to elements that have editable text except for 
<input>
 elements with the attribute: 
type="password"
, 
type="email"
, or 
type="url"
.




autofocus




Indicates that an element is to be focused on page load, or as soon as the 
<dialog>
 it is part of is displayed. This attribute is a boolean, initially false.




class




A space-separated list of the classes of the element. Classes allow CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements via the 
class selectors
 or functions like the method 
Document.getElementsByClassName()
.




contenteditable




An 
enumerated
 attribute indicating if the element should be editable by the user. If so, the browser modifies its widget to allow editing. The attribute must take one of the following values:




true
 or the 
empty string
, which indicates that the element must be editable;


false
, which indicates that the element must not be editable.


plaintext-only
, which indicates the element's raw text is editable, but rich text formatting is disabled.






data-*




Forms a class of attributes, called custom data attributes, that allow proprietary information to be exchanged between the 
HTML
 and its 
DOM
 representation that may be used by scripts. All such custom data are available via the 
HTMLElement
 interface of the element the attribute is set on. The 
HTMLElement.dataset
 property gives access to them.




dir




An enumerated attribute indicating the directionality of the element's text. It can have the following values:




ltr
, which means 
left to right
 and is to be used for languages that are written from the left to the right (like English);


rtl
, which means 
right to left
 and is to be used for languages that are written from the right to the left (like Arabic);


auto
, which lets the user agent decide. It uses a basic algorithm as it parses the characters inside the element until it finds a character with a strong directionality, then it applies that directionality to the whole element.






draggable




An enumerated attribute indicating whether the element can be dragged, using the 
Drag and Drop API
. It can have the following values:




true
, which indicates that the element may be dragged


false
, which indicates that the element may not be dragged.






enterkeyhint




Hints what action label (or icon) to present for the enter key on virtual keyboards.




exportparts




Used to transitively export shadow parts from a nested shadow tree into a containing light tree.




hidden




An enumerated attribute indicating that the element is not yet, or is no longer, 
relevant
. For example, it can be used to hide elements of the page that can't be used until the login process has been completed. The browser won't render such elements. This attribute must not be used to hide content that could legitimately be shown.




id




Defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking (using a fragment identifier), scripting, or styling (with CSS).




inert




A boolean value that makes the browser disregard user input events for the element. Useful when click events are present.




inputmode




Provides a hint to browsers about the type of virtual keyboard configuration to use when editing this element or its contents. Used primarily on 
<input>
 elements, but is usable on any element while in 
contenteditable
 mode.




is




Allows you to specify that a standard HTML element should behave like a registered customized built-in element (see 
Using custom elements
 for more details).








Note:

The 
item*
 attributes are part of the 
WHATWG HTML Microdata feature
.






itemid




The unique, global identifier of an item.




itemprop




Used to add properties to an item. Every HTML element may have an 
itemprop
 attribute specified, where an 
itemprop
 consists of a name and value pair.




itemref




Properties that are not descendants of an element with the 
itemscope
 attribute can be associated with the item using an 
itemref
. It provides a list of element ids (not 
itemid
s) with additional properties elsewhere in the document.




itemscope




itemscope
 (usually) works along with 
itemtype
 to specify that the HTML contained in a block is about a particular item. 
itemscope
 creates the Item and defines the scope of the 
itemtype
 associated with it. 
itemtype
 is a valid URL of a vocabulary (such as 
schema.org
) that describes the item and its properties context.




itemtype




Specifies the URL of the vocabulary that will be used to define 
itemprop
s (item properties) in the data structure. 
itemscope
 is used to set the scope of where in the data structure the vocabulary set by 
itemtype
 will be active.




lang




Helps define the language of an element: the language that non-editable elements are in, or the language that editable elements should be written in by the user. The attribute should contain a valid 
BCP 47 language tag
. 
xml:lang
 has priority over it.




nonce




A cryptographic nonce ("number used once") which can be used by 
Content Security Policy
 to determine whether or not a given fetch will be allowed to proceed.




part




A space-separated list of the part names of the element. Part names allows CSS to select and style specific elements in a shadow tree via the 
::part
 pseudo-element.




popover




Used to designate an element as a popover element (see 
Popover API
). Popover elements are hidden via 
display: none
 until opened via an invoking/control element (i.e., a 
<button>
 or 
<input type="button">
 with a 
popovertarget
 attribute) or a 
HTMLElement.showPopover()
 call.




role




Roles define the semantic meaning of content, allowing screen readers and other tools to present and support interaction with an object in a way that is consistent with user expectations of that type of object. 
roles
 are added to HTML elements using 
role="role_type"
, where 
role_type
 is the name of a role in the ARIA specification.




slot




Assigns a slot in a 
shadow DOM
 shadow tree to an element: An element with a 
slot
 attribute is assigned to the slot created by the 
<slot>
 element whose 
name
 attribute's value matches that 
slot
 attribute's value.




spellcheck




An enumerated attribute defines whether the element may be checked for spelling errors. It may have the following values:




empty string or 
true
, which indicates that the element should be, if possible, checked for spelling errors;


false
, which indicates that the element should not be checked for spelling errors.






style




Contains 
CSS
 styling declarations to be applied to the element. Note that it is recommended for styles to be defined in a separate file or files. This attribute and the 
<style>
 element have mainly the purpose of allowing for quick styling, for example for testing purposes.




tabindex




An integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is 
focusable
), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation, and if so, at what position. It can take several values:




a 
negative value
 means that the element should be focusable, but should not be reachable via sequential keyboard navigation;


0
 means that the element should be focusable and reachable via sequential keyboard navigation, but its relative order is defined by the platform convention;


a 
positive value
 means that the element should be focusable and reachable via sequential keyboard navigation; the order in which the elements are focused is the increasing value of the 
tabindex
. If several elements share the same tabindex, their relative order follows their relative positions in the document.






title




Contains a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip.




translate




An enumerated attribute that is used to specify whether an element's attribute values and the values of its 
Text
 node children are to be translated when the page is localized, or whether to leave them unchanged. It can have the following values:




empty string or 
yes
, which indicates that the element will be translated.


no
, which indicates that the element will not be translated.






virtualkeyboardpolicy
 


Experimental






An 
enumerated
 attribute used to control the on-screen virtual keyboard behavior on devices such as tablets, mobile phones, or other devices where a hardware keyboard may not be available for elements that its content is editable (for example, it is an 
<input>
 or 
<textarea>
 element, or an element with the 
contenteditable
 attribute set).




auto
 or an 
empty string
, which automatically shows the virtual keyboard when the element is focused or tapped.


manual
, which decouples focus and tap on the element from the virtual keyboard's state.






writingsuggestions




An 
enumerated
 attribute indicating if browser-provided writing suggestions should be enabled under the scope of the element or not.




false
, which disables the browser's writing suggestions.


true
 or an 
empty string
, which enables writing suggestions.










List of global event handler attributes


HTML event handler attributes are discouraged; see 
HTML attribute reference
 for how they work.


While the attributes listed below apply to all elements, they are not useful on all elements. For example, 
onvolumechange
 HTML attribute is accepted by all elements and attaches an event listener for 
volumechange
, but only media elements will ever receive a 
volumechange
 event fired by the browser. For other elements, you can only use 
EventTarget.dispatchEvent()
 to manually dispatch one. 
Some attributes
 can be specified on 
<body>
, but they would instead listen to events on 
window
.
