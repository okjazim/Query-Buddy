the ayer collection of the newberry library who so freely and generously made available to me the great collections of works on the philippines in their libraries dr john h powell of the free library of philadelphia who helped me find reference books of the utmost importance and the many librarians who courteously answered written queries about early philippine material edwin wolf 2nd doctrina christiana the first book printed in the philippines has been the object of a hunt which has extended from manila to berlin and from italy to chile for four hundred and fifty years the patient research of scholars the scraps of evidence found in books and archives the amazingly accurate hypotheses of bibliographers who have sifted the material so painstakingly gathered together combine to make its history a bookish detective story par excellence it is easy when a prisoner has been arrested and brought to the dock to give details of his complexion height characteristics and identifying marks to fingerprint him and to photograph him but how inadequate was the description before his capture how frequently did false scents draw the pursuer off the right track it is with this in mind that we examine the subject of this investigation remembering that it has not been done before in detail and to complete the case the book has been photographed in its entirety and its facsimile herewith published in studying the doctrina christiana of 1593 there are four general problems which we shall discuss first we shall give a physical description of the book secondly we shall trace chronologically the bibliographical history of the doctrina that is we shall record the available evidence which shows that it was the first book printed in the philippines and weigh the testimonies which state or imply to the contrary thirdly we shall try to establish the authorship of the text and lastly we shall discuss the actual printing it hardly needs be told why so few of the incunabula of the philippines have survived the paper on which they were printed was one of the most destructible papers ever used in book production the native worms and insects thrived on it and the heat and dampness took their slower but equally certain toll add to these enemies the acts of providence of which the philippines have received more than their shareearthquake fire and floodand the manmade devastations of war combined with the fact that there was no systematic attempt made in the philippines to preserve in archives and libraries the records of the past and it can well be understood why a scant handful of cradlebooks have been preserved the two fires of 1603 alone which burned the dominican convent in manila to the ground and consumed the whole of binondo just outside the walls must have played untold havoc upon the records of the early missionaries perhaps the only copies of early philippine books which exist today unchronided and forgotten are those which were sent to europe in the 16th 17th and 18th centuries and may now be lying uncatalogued in some library there one copy of this doctrina was sent to philip ii by the governor of the philippines in 1593 and in 1785 a jesuit philologist hervas y panduro printed tagalog texts from a then extant copy yet since that time no example is recorded as having been seen by bibliographer or historian the provenance of the present one is but imperfectly known in the spring of 1946 william h schab a new york dealer was in paris and heard through a friend of the existence of a 1593 manila book he expressed such incredulity at this information that his friend feeling his integrity impugned telephoned the owner then and there and confirmed the unbelievable 1593 delighted and enthused schab arranged to meet him found that he was a paris bookseller and collector who specialized in pacific imprints and was fully aware of the importance of the volume and induced him to sell the precious doctrina he brought it back with him to the united states and offered it to lessing j rosenwald who promptly purchased it and presented it to the library of congress where the book had been before it reached paris we do not know perhaps it is the very copy sent to philip ii perhaps the copy from which hervas got his text indeed it may have been churned to the surface by the late civil war in spain and sent from there to france in the course of years from similar sources may come other books to throw more light upon the only too poorly documented history of the establishment of printing in the philippine islands the physical description let us first examine the book as it appears before us the titlepage reads doctrina christiana en lengua espanola ytagala cor regida por los religiosos de las ordenes impressa con licencia en s gabriel de la orden de s domigo en manila 1593 the book printed in gothic letters and tagalog 1 characters on paper made from the paper mulberry now browned and brittle with age consists of thirtyeight leaves comprising a titlepage as above under a woodcut 2 of st dominic with the verso originally blank but in this copy bearing the contemporary manuscript inscription tassada en dos rreales signed juan de cuellar and seventyfour pages of text in spanish tagalog transliterated into roman letters and tagalog in tagalog characters the size of the volume which is unbound is 9 18 by 7 inches although individual leaves vary somewhat due to chipping some of the leaves have become separated from their complements but enough remain in the original stitching to indicate that the book was originally made up in four gatherings the first of twelve leaves the second of ten the third of ten and the fourth of six although the book is of the size called quarto the method of printing must have been page by page so it is doubtful that each sheet was folded twice in the usual quarto manner but more probable that it was printed four pages to a sheet of paper approximately 9 18 by 14 inches which was folded once the volume is printed throughout by the xylographic method that is to say each page of text is printed from one woodblock which was carved by hand along the inner margins of some pages are vertical lines which were made by the inked edge of the block and the grain of the wood has caused striations to appear in the printed portions throughout the unevenness of the impression indicates that the pages were printed in some primitive manner without the help of a conventional press the paper which is one of the distinctive features of most old oriental books has been discussed at length by pardo de tavera in his study of early philippine printing and we can do no better than translate the relevant passage in full i have said before that the material composition of our books is inferior the imprints before 1830 were made on a paper called by some rice paper by others silk paper and by still others china paper according to their taste it is detestable brittle without consistency or resistance and was called rice paper because it was supposed to be made from that grain it was the only kind then used in the philippines not only for printing but for all manner of writing letters etc and it is even recorded that in 1874 when tobacco was a state monopoly cigarettes were made with this paper and that the indians and chinese preferred it and perhaps they still do to rag paper or other kinds because of the horrible taste it gives the tobacco in china they commonly made paper of bamboo but more principally from cotton and a plant which travellers have cited only by its common name which they transcribe in various ways calling it kochu kotsu or kotzu today it is known that this plant is an ulmacea broussonetia papyrifera from a mash of which they still make cloth in japan cotton paper is superior to it and naturally more expensive but the paper of inferior quality which was received in manila where nothing was imported regularly but common articles of low price was of kotsu as all chinesemade paper it was coated with alum the finer the paper the thicker the coating for the purpose of whitening it and making the surface smooth a deplorable business for it made the paper very moisture absorbent a condition fatal in such a humid climate as in these islands moreover as the alum used is impure and contains a large proportion of iron salts the humidity and weather oxidize it which finally darkens the paper so that philippine books present a coloration which runs the gamut of tones from the color of bone to that of dark cinnamon 3 because the doctrina christiana which may well be translated the teachings of christianity contains the basic elements of the religion which the missionaries were trying to spread among the unbaptized in the remote regions of the world it was the most useful handbook they had a summary of the contents of the present edition shows the fundamental character of the work after a syllabary comes the pater noster the primary and most popular prayer of christianity then follow the ave maria credo salve regina articles of faith ten commandments commandments of the holy church sacraments of the holy church seven mortal sins fourteen works of charity confession and catechism here in a small compass is presented the simplest most easily learned and most essential tenets of the catholic church so useful was the doctrina considered as a guide for those who had just been or were about to be converted that the missionary fathers placed it in most cases foremost among the books necessary to have in print in a strange land it is generally accepted today although no extant copy is known that the first book printed in mexico 4 in 1539 was a doctrina in mexican and spanish recent research has shown that the second book printed by the pioneer jesuit press at goa in india in 1557 was st francis xaviers doutrina christao 5 in the malay language of which also no copy has yet been located but there are copies of the first book to come from a south american press another doctrina 6 printed in the native and spanish languages at lima in 1584 so the choice of this book as the first to be printed at manila follows a widespread precedent we have then a book the doctrina christiana in spanish and tagalog corrected by priests of more than one orderand this is important in tracing the authorship of the workand printed by the xylographic method with license at manila at the dominican church of san gabriel in 1593 so much we get from the title and in itself it is a fairly complete story but from the date of its issue until the present time that very fundamental information has not been completely recorded the bibliographical history in tracing our clues down through the years we find at the very beginning the most valuable evidence which has been uncovered short of the book itself from manila on june 20 1593 the governor of the philippines gomez perez dasmarinas wrote a letter to philip ii of spain in which he said sire in the name of your majesty i have for this once because of the existing great need granted a license for the printing of the doctrinas christianas herewith enclosedone in the tagalog language which is the native and best of these islands and the other in chinesefrom which i hope great benefits will result in the conversion and instruction of the peoples of both nations and because the lands of the indies are on a larger scale in everything and things more expensive i have set the price of them at four reales a piece until your majesty is pleased to decree in full what is to be done 7 this states unequivocally that two books were printed at manila some time before june 20 1593 one of which was the doctrina in tagalog and the other the same work in chinese although we are chiefly concerned here with the former the fact that they were produced at about the same time and probably at the same place makes it necessary to trace the history of both in order to reconstruct the circumstances surrounding the production of the one of the chinese doctrina no copy has yet come to light and except for two 1593 references there are no records of its existence another document 8 of 1593 verifies the information given in the letter of dasmarinas differing from it only in one detail in the archives of the indies was found a manuscript account of 1593 listing books written in the philippines which says there have been printed primers and catechisms of the faith one in spanish and tagalog which is the native language and the other in chinese which are being sent to your majesty the tagalog priced at two reales and the chinese at four which is hoped will be of great benefit the accounts of the printing of two doctrinas contained in these documents confirm some of the information of the title and add a bit more first the letter says that the book was printed by permission given by the governor which agrees with the with license of the title for this once because of the existing great need by a royal cedula 9 of september 21 1556 which was promulgated again on august 14 1560 it had been ordered that justices not consent to or permit to be printed or sold any book containing material concerning the indies without having special license sent by our royal council of the indies and on may 8 1584 this was implemented by the further order that when any grammar or dictionary of the language of the indies be made it shall not be published or printed or used unless it has first been examined by the bishop and seen by the royal audiencia this latter portion was applied specifically to the philippines in a letter 10 from philip ii to the audiencia of manila also dated may 8 1584 to which further reference will be made it can be gathered from dasmarinas implied apology that he had never before given such a license and since he had arrived in the philippines in 1590 that no books had been printed between that time and the licensing of the doctrinas it is moreover likely that if any similar books had been printed during the administrations of his predecessors he would have mentioned the fact as a precedent for acting contrary to the cedulas according to dasmarinas he had priced the books at four reales a piece which followed the regular spanish procedure under which books were subject to price control the governor it will be noted also apologized for the high price he was forced to set giving general high prices 11 as his excuse yet while the appraisal of four reales for this book was high compared to the prevailing scale in spain it was not high compared to prices allowed in mexico on june 6 1542 the emperor had given the casa de cromberger the first printinghouse in mexico permission 12 to sell books printed there at seventeen maravedis a sheet or exactly one half a real if we assume that although the doctrina had been printed page by page it was quarto in size and so appraised on the basis of eight pages to a sheet we find that the price per sheet comes to about fourteen maravedis or less than half a real however a contradiction occurs between the letter of dasmarinas and this copy of the doctrina supported by the other 1593 document on the verso of the title juan de cuellar 13 the governors secretary and the logical person to sign the official valuation gives the price as two reales and the 1593 account while agreeing with the letter as far as the chinese doctrina is concerned also lists the price of the tagalog doctrina as two reales it is impossible to say what caused the discrepancy perhaps it was a decision on dasmarinas part to lower the cost notwithstanding inflationary values in order to make the book more readily available for the natives who were not economically as well off as the chinese or it could be that after the letter had been written it was noticed that the chinese volume was larger than the tagalog one and some adjustment made in any event the price of this doctrina was finally set at two reales making it less than half the price allowed in mexico fifty years before the evidence of the two 1593 documents would seem conclusive with regard to printing in 1593 but witnesses were not long in appearing who stated something quite different the earliest of these was pedro chirino 14 a jesuit priest who came to the philippines with dasmarinas in 1590 he went back to europe in 1602 and while there had a history of the philippines printed at rome in 1604 in 1606 he returned to the islands where he died in 1635 he left unpublished the manuscript of another and more detailed history dated 1610 which contains a most significant passage where after speaking of various early writers in native languages he continues those who printed first were p fr juan de villanueva of the order of st augustine who printed certain little tracts and p fr francisco de san joseph of the order of st dominic who printed larger things of more bulk 15 concerning this juan de villanueva 16 very little indeed is known from what has been recorded it would seem that there were two augustinians of the same name who were in the philippines before 1600 the first of these was a secular priest who came to cebu about 1566 may have taken the augustinian habit some time after his arrival and died not long after 1569 the other juan de villanueva the date of whose arrival is unknown was in lubao in 1590 in hagonoy in 1593 and prior of batangas from 1596 until his death in 1599 of the two there can be no doubt but that chirino referred to the second one but apart from chirinos note there is no record anywhere that works by him existed nor do the augustinian chroniclers themselves except for the modern santiago vela who knew of chirinos citation mention him as a linguist or a writer the only possibility is that between 1593 and 1599 villanueva had printed some small xylographic books no copies and no further record of which have appeared as for francisco de san joseph or blancas de san jose as he is more frequently called there are other references to his part in the establishment of printing in the islands from information doubtless obtained from diego aduarte then in spain alonso fernandez wrote in his ecclesiastical history printed at toledo in 1611 father fr francisco blancas printed in the tagalog language and characters a book of our lady of the rosary in the year 1602 which was the first book that was printed there of that or any other material after this he printed another of the sacraments in the language of the philippines in both characters theirs and ours from which the greatest results have been achieved 17 two years later the same author published at madrid an account 18 of the miracles performed by the rosary of the virgin in which he included a list of of some writers of the order of st dominic who were living in this year 1612 and gave the same information as above adding only that the printing took place in bataan diego aduarte 19 whose history of the dominican province of the philippines is one of the best contemporary ones written bears out these statements of which he was most probably the source aduarte came to the islands in company with his close friend blancas de san jose in 1595 went back to spain as procurator of his order in 1607 and returned to manila in 1628 staying in the orient until his death in 1636 his history was continued and edited after his death by a fellow dominican domingo goncalez who had it printed in 1640 summarizing the life and accomplishments of blancas de san jose aduarte wrote so he was sent to bataan which is near there manila where he learned the language of the indians called tagalog which is the most common in this country and is used among the indians for many leagues around the city so rapid was his study of the language that he began to preach in it within three months and could teach it to others in six and believing that he was the instrument needed to bring the holy gospel to the indians he spared no pains to investigate the fitness of their words the way to use them and all the rest so that he could succeed in mastering it he wrote many books of devotion for them and since there was no printing in these islands and no one who understood it or who was a journeyman printer he planned to have it done through a chinaman a good christian who seeing that the books of p fr francisco were sure to be of great use bestowed so much care upon this undertaking that he finally succeeded aided by those who told him whatever they knew about it in learning everything necessary to do printing and he printed these books he blancas de san jose printed a grammar to learn the tagalog language a memorial of the christian life a book on the four last things another on the preparation for the communion a confessionary another on the mysteries of the rosary of our lady and another to teach the tagalog indians the spanish language and he left many very pious and curious works in the language of these indians 20 blancas de san jose 21 as we have noted came to the philippines in 1595 he was at abucay in bataan from 1598 until 1602 and then spent several years in and about manila preaching to the indians and the chinese whose language he also mastered in 1614 he set out for spain but died on the voyage before reaching mexico of the books which he is said to have had printed only two are known to be extant the arte y reglas de la lengva tagala 22 and the librong pagaaralan nang manga tagalog nang uicang castilla 23 or libro en qve aprendan los tagalos la lengua castellana both printed at bataan in 1610 and until the discovery of the present doctrina and the ordinationes of 1604 the earliest surviving philippine imprints known we have not cited here in detail the account of juan lopez 24 in the fifth part of his history of the dominicans because although it was printed nineteen years before the appearance of aduartes work the information therein contained regarding the philippines was acknowledgedly obtained from the unfinished manuscript which aduarte had with him in spain the pertinent passages add nothing to aduartes information and even the wording is reminiscent of his the first suggestion that early philippine books may have been printed from woodblocks occurred in quetif and echards bibliography of dominican writers printed at paris in 1719 there after listing eight works by blancas de san jose they add he published all these in the philippines with the help of a chinese christian using chinese blocks for in his day european typographers had not yet arrived in those islands nor did they have types for their language 25 this was an amazing suggestion for as far as we know the bibliographers who made it had not actually seen the books nor is it entirely true the first two works listed are two books we know were printed typographically in 1610 the sixth is de los mysterios del rosario de nuestra senora tagalice the book referred to by fernandez as having been printed in 1602 and generally accepted as being from movable type although no copy has been discovered to prove it and yet it is not at all impossible that some time before 1602 blancas de san jose had some of his writings printed from blocks in any event the idea later developed by medina and retana that xylography was used before a real printingpress was established may have come from this not wholly accurate note for almost a hundred and fifty years no historian or bibliographer wrote anything to challenge the basic affirmations of chirino fernandez and aduarte in the middle of the 18th century lorenzo hervas y panduro 26 a jesuit was forced by the expulsion of the jesuits from spain to seek refuge in the papal states and took up residence at cesena there he began work on a tremendous universal history of the spiritual development of man into which he wove the results of his philosophical social and linguistic studies these last were of particular importance and hervas is regarded as the true founder of the science of linguistics and comparative philology in 1785 he published the eighteenth volume of his massive work the origine formazione meccanismo ed armonia degl idiomi in which he printed a tagalog ave maria as written in 1593 with the note the ave maria in the tagalog of 1593 is to be read in the tagalogspanish doctrina christiana which was printed in tagalog and roman characters by the dominican fathers in their printinghouse at manila in the year 1593 27 in 1787 he finished his twentyfirst volume saggio pratico 28 which was another philological study including the pater noster in over three hundred languages and dialects among them tagalog again from the 1593 doctrina here then is ample proof that a copy of this book was known to hervas in 1785 and the only information which his loose transcription of the title failed to give was that the volume was corrected by members of the orders that it was printed with license and that it was printed at san gabriel at the beginning of the following century two german scholars familiar with hervas writings noted the 1593 doctrina franz carl alter 29 in his monograph on the tagalog language printed the ave maria from the text which had appeared in 1785 and johann christoph adelung 30 in his mithridates a comprehensive study of languages included the tagalog pater noster from the saggio pratico of 1787 the latter also listed in a short bibliography of the tagalog language the doctrina of 1593 giving exactly the same information about it that hervas had neither of these men apparently saw a copy of the book limiting themselves to extracts from hervas but they perpetuated an earlier reference of the utmost importance shortly after the two germans published their notices of the 1593 doctrina an entry appeared of a book printed at manila in 1581 jose mariano beristain y sousa a learned mexican writer issued in 181921 a bibliography of spanishamerican books in which he listed alphabetically the authors giving a short biography of each and adding a list of his works under juan de quinones we find arte y vocabulario de la lengua tagala imp en manila 1581 31 no specific authority is given for this entry but in his sketch of the life of quinones beristain cited as sources juan de grijalva nicolas antonio gaspar de san agustin and jose sicardo it would seem logical that one of these must have mentioned such a work as printed in manila in 1581 but in tracing down the sources no such precise notice is found grijalva simply said that quinones concerned himself with tagalog and made a vocabulary and grammar of it 32 antonio 33 referred to grijalva and carried the matter no further san agustin describing the franciscan chapter of 1578 wrote it was determined moreover in this chapter that p fr juan de quinones prior of the convent of taal in tagalos and fr diego de ochoa prior of bacolor in pampanga should compose and fashion grammars dictionaries and confessionaries in the two languages respectively tagalog and pampanga in which they had ventured which they executed very promptly and well and these were of great use to those who came to these islands for they had these by which they could study the languages 34 later san agustin again mentioning quinones referred to grijalva and added as an additional source for his information tomas de herrera sicardo 35 added nothing new herrera not cited directly by beristain may however have been the source from which the imp of his entry came herrera wrote he quinones was the first to have learned the tagalog language of which he published a grammar and dictionary as an aid to the ministers of the gospel if beristain read this he may have been misled by the latin of published 36 in lucem edidit which may indeed mean printed and published but also means quite properly published in the sense of written in manuscript and copied and circulated we agree with schilling 37 that this latter meaning was the one intended one other statement that quinones works were printed may derive from the same misunderstanding about the year 1801 pedro bello wrote an account still in manuscript and unpublished of the writings of the augustinians his remarks on quinones first printed by santiago vela 38 we believe are only an extension of herreras in lucem edidit this same confusion in terminology has been used 39 to support beristains claim by introducing as evidence the letter of philip ii of may 8 1584 salazar the bishop of manila probably shortly after the synod of 1582 had written the king a letter now unfortunately lost in which he spoke of a decision to standardize linguistic works in answer to the bishop the following letter in the form of a royal cedula was sent to the president and judges of my royal audiencia situated in the city of manila in the philippine islandsit has been told me on behalf of don fray domingo de salazar bishop of that place that it was agreed that no priest might make a grammar or vocabulary and that if it were made it might not be published before being examined and approved by the said bishop because otherwise there would result great differences and disagreements in the doctrine and this having been seen by my council of the indies it was agreed that i should order this my cedula which decrees that when any grammar or vocabulary be made it shall not be published or used unless it has first been examined by the said bishop and seen by this audencia 40 here again the word publicado is brought forth to prove that the letter referred to printed works but here again the term is equally applicable to manuscript works in common use and generally available further evidence that there was no printing as early as 1581 is to be found in a letter 41 from juan de plasencia a tagalist of great renown to the king dated from manila june 18 1585 in which he reported on the state of missionary work in china and japan and added that he had written a grammar and a declaration of the whole doctrina in the most common language of the philippines and that he was then making a dictionary concluding by asking the king to send decrees ordering those works to be printed in mexico at the expense of the exchequer is it likely that plasencia would have so written if an arte y vocabulario had been printed four years earlier furthermore san antonio recording the book on the customs and rites of the indians written by plasencia at the request of the governor santiago de vera and dated october 24 1589 said that it was not printed because printing houses had not yet come to this country 42 we then conclude with regard to beristains entry that although there existed in manuscript an arte y vocabuldrio tagalo by juan de quinones there is no evidence of the existence of any book printed for him from woodblocks or in type santiago de vela 43 suggests the possibility that there might have been a xylographic arte of 1581 but schilling 44 questions this in the face of the complete lack of reference to such a printed work by any 17th or 18th century writer and the tenuous notices of bello and beristain yet to say categorically that no such work was printed would be foolhardy in the face of the scanty early records and the appearance of this doctrina a single copy of which has just been discovered the first important work devoted solely to the early history of the philippine press was by th pardo de tavera who in 1893 published his study of printing and engraving in the philippines he there recorded a 1593 doctrina but adamantly refused to accept it on the hearsay evidence of others his account is valuable because it shows that there may have been a copy of the doctrina in java in 1885 and so we quote from it at some length a learned dutch orientalist dr j brandes wrote me in 1885 from baliboeleleng java telling me that in 1593 at manila there was printed a doctrina christiana in spanishtagalog with the proper characters for the latter language other orientalists at the last congress in london in 1891 gave me the same information nonetheless no one told me where he had read such a thing nor much less that he had managed to see such a book although inspecting a rare book which i acquired in paris alter ueber die tagalische sprache vienna 1803 i saw that the author cited such a doctrina christiana and said that he knew of its existence through abbe hervas this is an error and without doubt such a doctrina was in manuscript because in 1591 he should have said 1593 there was no press in manila nor in any part of the archipelago and today we know for certain and positively that the first book issued there appeared in 1610 45 pardo de tavera was the first to call attention to alter and through him to hervas and in all probability the orientalists at the london congress had seen the doctrina cited by one of these or adelung but he rejects that evidence in no uncertain terms mitigating somewhat his assurance he speaks following the abovequoted passage of printing in china and differentiates between xylographic and typographic printing and since he was obviously thinking in terms of printing on a press with movable type his conclusions are not too extreme in 1896 appeared jose toribio medinas la imprenta en manila which was up to then the best most complete and most scholarly work on early philippine printing and is today with its subsequent additions and corrections the standard bibliography of the subject there medina cited most of the authorities we have already quoted the letter of dasmarinas fernandez historia eclesiastica aduarte adelung beristain and pardo de tavera then basing his conclusions strongly on the dasmarinas letter and the note of adelung he listed 46 as number one in his bibliography the doctrina of 1593 in spanish and tagalog and as number two the doctrina in spanish and chinese of the same year this is a verdict which has stood the test of time and one that is just now confirmed by the discovery of the book itself two points however in his survey should be noted in his discussion of the printing and the authorship medina does not emphasize the dominican origin of the book although he does say that it does not appear bold to us to suppose that the imprint of these doctrinas ought to be the hospital of san gabriel in this village binondo 47 and faithfully copies adelungs imprint notice in the dominican printinghouse in his listing of the book the other point is that he says in his introduction and repeats in his entry that the doctrina had a latin as well as spanish and tagalog texts an erroneous translation of adelungs mit lateinische und tagalische schrift he was hesitant as are all bibliographers who must perforce record the probable existence of a book a copy of which they have never seen in committing himself as to whether it was printed from blocks or from type or by a combination of the two methods more positive and more succinct than medina was te retana whose earlier researches 48 into the history of the philippines medina acknowledgedly made use of and who in 1897 published his la imprenta en filipinas adiciones y observaciones a la imprenta en manila he took the material of medina added the evidence of chirino and plasencia and resummarized the problem the letter of dasmarinas showed conclusively that a doctrina was printed in 1593 chirino said that the first two whose works were printed were juan de villanueva and blancas de san jose fernandez stated positively that the first book printed in the philippines was the book of our lady of the rosary by blancas de san jose printed at bataan in 1602 aduarte supported this without mentioning a title place or date of printing if we are to accept all these statements as incontrovertible how can the apparent contradictions be reconciled the answer had already been hinted at but retana solved the problem with amazing acumen and arrived at four conclusions which are here printed in his own words athat the doctrinas of 1593 though printed at manila were not executed in type but by the socalled xylographic method bthat the initiative for the establishment of typography is owed to p fr francisco blancas de san jose cthat the first typographer was the chinese christian juan de vera at the instigation of the said father san jose dthat the first typographical printing of this dominican author is of the year 1602 49 it is not difficult to say with the book itself in front of us that it is an example of xylographic printing but it was a great feat on the part of retana who had never seen a copy to resolve apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion on the part of several unquestioned authorities by deducing that it was all a matter of semanticswhat did printing mean as for the sprite of 1581 introduced by beristain retana dismissed it on the grounds of insufficient evidence in a word he concluded that the first book issued in the philippines was a doctrina printed from woodblocks in 1593 all subsequent writers on the subject have derived their information from the sources we have already mentioned and to a great degree have been influenced by the findings of medina and retana the rev thomas cooke middleton 50 in 1900 confessed that he did not know what the first book printed was pardo de tavera maintained his old intransigence when in the introduction to his bibliography for the library of congress in 1903 he wrote that medinas affirmation that printing took place in 1593 loses all validity in the face of the categorical statement of f alonso fernandez 51 medina did not comment further in his adiciones y ampliaciones 52 of 1904 yet when the same year perez and gueemes 53 published their additions to and continuation of medina bringing his bibliography down to 1850 they resurrected the 1581 arte but added no new evidence to prove their case blair and robertson in their tremendous collective history of the philippines did not include a list of philippine imprints in their bibliography 54 but referred readers to medina and retana with whom they agreed to celebrate the three hundredth anniversary of typographical printing in the philippines artigas y cuerva 55 wrote a study which emphasized the part played by blancas de san jose but did not deny the existence of the 1593 doctrina retana 56 in 1911 brought his work on the subject up to date but retained all his major conclusions in palaus standard bibliography of spanish books we find the doctrinas called the two earliest books known to have been printed in manila 57 finally the most thorough recent work on the subject is to be found in schillings 58 survey of the early history of the philippine press published in 1937 there is little that can be added to the evidence uncovered by these modern writers but the appearance of the book itself enables us to say with certainty some things which they were able only to surmise however as regards the authorship and the circumstances and place of printing we are able from the information given on the title to carry the investigation somewhat further the authorship of the text the title tells us that the book was corrected by the priests of more than one order and since it was printed by the dominicans we can assume that the ultimate responsibility for the preparation of the text in consultation with friars of other orders also lay in their hands our problem then is to discover what texts were available to them in 1593 and who were the priests who formed the editorial board we have included in this study also the origins of the chinese text for the two doctrinas appeared at the same time and as we shall see the same dominicans were probably responsible for the production and preparation of both the tagalog and the chinese texts during the period under discussion there were priests of four orders active in the islands and so we shall speak in turn of the augustinian franciscan jesuit and dominican fathers who might have written or worked on the doctrinas printed in 1593 the augustinians the first priests to come to the philippines were six augustinians who accompanied legazpi on the expedition which in 1565 established the first permanent european settlement in the islands among them was martin de rada who was one of the most important and influential priests during the early days of the spanish colony and who was the first linguist of note to work in the philippines the first language he learned was visayan 59 native to the island of cebu where the spaniards first landed but he also learned chinese in may 1572 he was elected provincial of his order and in june 1575 he went with jeronimo marin as ambassador to china being the first spaniard who entered into that said kingdom 60 in preparation for the voyage we are told by gonzalez de mendoza whose famous and popular history of china first printed in 1585 derives in a great measure from information brought back by rada that rada began with great care studie to learne that language chinese the which he learned in few daies did make thereof a dictionarie 61 rada was then not only the first to write in visayan but also the first to compile a chinese dictionary and more important still brought back with him to manila from china many books of which mendoza gives a list 62 these books printed in the usual chinese method from woodblocks could have provided models for the spaniards in the philippines who lacked european facilities for printing and they may have given birth to the idea which resulted in the xylographic doctrinas within the first few years several more augustinian fathers 63 arrived whose linguistic accomplishments are briefly noted by the historians but while these men were certainly pioneers in the speaking of tagalog and chinese they are not recorded as having written in the language according to cano 64 the first tagalog grammar was written by agustin de alburquerque and retana 65 considered him one of the possible authors of the present doctrina this friar reached the philippines in 1571 accompanied rada on his second expedition to china in 1576 was elected provincial in 1578 and died in 1580 however there is no early record saying that alburquerque wrote any linguistic work the statement was not made until the 19th century and in contradiction juan de medina who wrote in 1630 said that juan de quinones made a grammar and lexicon of the tagal language which was the first to make a start in the rules of its mode of speech 66 furthermore in the official acts 67 of the augustinian province we find that on august 20 1578 alburquerque as provincial of the order commissioned quinones to write a grammar dictionary and confessionary in the tagalog language the conclusions of santiago de vela 68 are that it is doubtful that alburquerque wrote any linguistic works and if he did they were liable to have been rough preliminary studies 69 upon which the texts of quinones were based in view of the lack of positive contemporary evidence 70 we believe that alburquerque may be eliminated except as the instigator of such works and we return again to juan de quinones in so far as quinones 71 was the author of a grammar and dictionary claimed to have been printed at manila in 1581 we have shown what various writers have said and though we must conclude that the work was probably not printed it is certain that he wrote in the tagalog language agustin maria de castro 72 said although no earlier writers support it that quinones actually presented a grammar dictionary and doctrina in tagalog at the synod of 1582 for its approval our total information about this augustinian linguist boils down to these essentials that he did write a grammar and dictionary of tagalog about 157881 which may have been the earliest written in the philippines that he may have presented these and a doctrina at the synod of 1582 which approved juan de plasencias works that there is no concrete evidence that any of these works were printed and that quinones works which were extant in manuscript in 1593 might have been consulted in the preparation of the present doctrina another member of the order of st augustine who might have been able to participate in the editing of the 1593 doctrinas was diego munoz munoz came to the islands in 1578 and died in 1594 of him san agustin writes moreover in this year 1581 the ministry for the sangleys was founded in the convent of tondo and p fr diego munoz was named as its special minister he devoted particular zeal to the study of the chinese language and preached in it with much elegance and all the sangleys who were going to be baptized and there were many had recourse to this ministry and the teaching was continued with much vigilance and care and there never lacked a religious of our order to apply himself to such holy work from the time we came to this land as our original records of the province prove 73 to him is also attributed 74 a volume of manuscript panegyric sermons in tagalog and because of this and his work at tondo he may have been consulted by the dominicans we also mention lorenzo de leon 75 who arrived in 1582 spent twelve years in the provinces wrote a book called the estrella del mar in tagalog and died in 1623 and might also have helped the franciscans although the first franciscans did not arrive in the philippines until june 24 1577 the writings of the linguists of that order are more fully recorded among the earliest was juan de plasencia who the franciscans claim wrote the first tagalog grammar he was fortunate in meeting soon after his arrival miguel de talavera 76 who had come with his parents on the expedition of legazpi miguel then quite young became in a manner of speaking the disciple of plasencia and while the father taught him latin he in turn taught plasencia the elements of tagalog which he had picked up for two years plasencia ministered in the provinces of tayabas laguna and bulacan where he used and perfected his knowledge of the native language on may 20 1579 when the provincial pedro de alfaro left for china he named plasencia acting provincial during his absence a reference to the earliest linguistic writings of the franciscans occurs in an account by santa ines of the chapter meeting held in the convent of los angeles in july 1580 which was presided over by plasencia the third and last thing that was determined in this chapter was that a grammar and dictionary of the tagalog language should be made and a translation of the doctrina christiana completed and since fr juan de plasencia the president of this same chapter excelled all in the language he was given this responsibility and he accepted it and immediately set to work and then after great study much lack of sleep and care together with fervent prayers and other spiritual duties of not little importance in the good profit of such work he reduced the language to a grammar made a catechism a very full dictionary and various translations 77 but the most important record of his writings is contained in the description of the synod called by bishop salazar in 1582 in march 1581 domingo de salazar the first bishop of manila and the philippines had arrived the problems which faced him were manifold particularly those of ecclesiastical jurisdiction the treatment of the natives by government administrators and the means by which the gospel could best be spread a synod was called to resolve these points one matter of the utmost importance was the approval of standard tagalog texts and juan de la concepcion gives the following account of what transpired in this connection his excellency presided at the meetings at them the most learned topics were discussed and the most learned persons were presentthe dominican father salvatierra the most outstanding scholars among the augustinians and franciscans the jesuit fathers sedeno and sanchez and the licentiate don diego vasquez de mercado as dean of the new cathedral at this convention or diocesan synod it was discussed whether the indians were to be ministered to in their native language or if they would be obliged to learn spanish and it was decided to instruct them in their native tongue the divine office the doctrina christiana which father fr juan de plasencia had translated into the tagalog language was approved his work the arte y vocabuldrio tagalo was judged most useful because of the ease by which it permitted an understanding and thorough knowledge of so foreign a language 78 the already quoted account of santa ines continues with a similar description of the synod and says that when the problem of teaching the natives was brought up only plasencia could resolve it since having seen his catechism and the translation which he had made in tagalog of the grammar and dictionary those who were at the synod and understood anything of the language could do nothing but admire the fitness of the terms their efficacy and strength and they said that without the particular help of heaven it seemed impossible that in so short a time and with so few years in the country he could have done such excellent work and then having approved them they ordered that various copies be made particularly of the translation of the doctrina so that with them and with no other would the ministers teach the indians and so it was approved in order that there might be uniformity in all parts of the tagalog country this translation is that which has come down to this day except that it is more polished 79 it must have been shortly after the handbooks of plasencia received the seal of ecclesiastical approval that salazar wrote the king speaking of the action taken and got back in answer the cedula quoted before giving the bishop and audiencia the right of censorship over such works the question of chronological precedence 80 between quinones and plasencia is not important for the specific approval of plasencias texts by the synod attended by quinones himself shows that plasencias books were accepted and in conformity with the ruling of the synod would have been the only texts allowed to be used generally in the philippines another reference to writers in the native tongues in an anonymous manuscript of 1649 introduces the names of other linguists the first missionaries left many writings in the tagalog and bicol languages the best of which are those left by fathers fray juan de oliver fray juan de plasencia fray miguel de talavera fray diego de la asuncion and fray geronimo monte mention is here made of the above fathers because they were the first masters of the tagalog language and since their writings are so common and so well received by all the orders they have not been printed because they are voluminous and there are no arrangements in this kingdom for printing so much 81 miguel de talavera we have spoken of before that he helped plasencia in the compilation of his earliest works in tagalog is clear and to him in part must be attributed the miracle of the production by plasencia of the texts in so short a time and with so few years in the country martinez says specifically that talavera was the first interpreter among our priests and greatly helped fr juan de plasencia in the composition of the arte y vocabulario 82 juan de oliver was in somewhat the same relationship to plasencia but instead of helping with the initial attempts he carried on from where plasencia left off oliver came to the philippines on the same expedition which brought bishop salazar in 1581 according to huerta 83 he worked in various tagalog villages and mastered the tagalog and bicol languages in which he wrote twentytwo works which huerta lists of these three are of particular interest to us the first entry says that he corrected the tagalog grammar written by fr juan de plasencia and added the adverbs and particles 84 the second that he perfected and augmented the spanishtagalog dictionary written by the said fr juan de plasencia and the sixteenth lists a catecismo de doctrina cristiana esplicado several authors attempting to establish the priority of quinones dictionary question the existence of one by plasencia at the synod of 1582 in the face of his own statement in 1585 that he was then making a dictionary 85 to us there seems to be no inconsistency if plasencia in 1585 was referring to a revision unquestionably made with his knowledge and help by juan de oliver in short it is reasonable to assume that plasencia burdened with administrative duties from 1583 to 1586 during which time he was custodian of his order secured the aid of oliver in reediting and continuing his linguistic studies plasencia died in 1590 the other two franciscans listed by the anonymous historian of 1649 are elsewhere recorded as having written various works in tagalog to both diego de la asuncion 86 and geronimo montes y escamillo 87 were attributed grammars and dictionaries and the latter also wrote a devotional tagalog said to have been printed at manila in 1610 in speaking of these early linguistic texts it is not necessary to believe that each was a completely original work but rather that they were based upon a recognized model which was at first the talaveraplasenciaoliver text and that the individual missionaries used their experience in the field to produce as it were new editions that this was the case is borne out by the notes of pablo rojo to his bibliography of plasencia where speaking of the grammar and dictionary he says that perfected by other missionaries they have been the base for such grammars and dictionaries of tagalog as have been written but in the form in which they came from the hands of their author they have not come down to us 88 more important still is rojos statement 89 that he found a portion of plasencias doctrina which had been believed lost and from which he quotes the pater noster since he does not say where the manuscript was or how it was known to be plasencias text we cannot put too much reliance on the statement but the text as there printed while similar to that of the present doctrina is not identical the jesuits before passing on to the dominicans we shall mention briefly the linguists of the society of jesus in the early days there were not many jesuits in the philippines however there were some linguists among them chiefly of the visayan tongue in which they are said to have printed a doctrina 90 as early as 1610 limiting ourselves to a note of those who knew chinese and tagalog we find that the first mentioned by chirino as an outstanding master of one of these was francisco almerique who arrived with santiago de vera in 1583 shortly thereafter he began the study of the chinese language in his zeal to aid in the conversion of the many chinese who came to manila and whom we in the philippines call sangleys 91 and colin says his principal occupation was with the tagalog indians being the first of the company to learn their language 92 nothing further is said of his accomplishments in these languages but his knowledge would have been available in 1593 for he was then still active in the islands chirino himself landed at manila in 1590 shortly after dasmarinas and went almost immediately to taytay where he learned tagalog and was joined in 1592 by martin henriquez at the time juan de oliver was preaching in that district and it is exceedingly probable that he helped the newcomers with the language for chirino speaks of him in terms of highest praise henriquez learned the language in three months and in six wrote a catechism in it a confessionary and a book of sermons for all the gospels of the year in the said idiom 93 but he died on february 3 1593 at taytay how thoroughly chirino himself had grasped the fundamentals of tagalog is evident from his three chapters 94 on the language and letters of the natives in which he prints the ave maria in tagalog and reproduces the tagalog alphabetits first appearance in a european publication but chirino who remained in the provinces until 1595 would have mentioned his participation and that of henriquez in the doctrina of 1593 so we record them as possible but not probable consultants the dominicans had aduarte written that the first books printed at manila were two doctrinas issued by the dominicans at san gabriel in 1593 and given some details of their production we could conclude our study with a quotation from him but nowhere does he mention them in fact his inference was that the first book was that printed for blancas de san jose and yet we know that this doctrina preceded anything that blancas de san jose could have written since he did not come to the philippines until 1595 we can assume as retana did that by printing aduarte meant printing from movable type but this does not explain away the fact that aduarte who recorded in detail events of far less significance did not speak of the doctrinas at all the bestand it is a most unsatisfactory bestthat we can do is ascribe the omission to the frailty of man and record that there is no notice of the dominican doctrina of 1593 in the most complete contemporary dominican history of the philippines the first members of the order of st dominic 95 to land in the philippines were bishop salazar and his assistant christoval de salvatierra but they were fully occupied with the administration of the bishopric and could not devote themselves to regular missionary work it was not until july 25 1587 that working dominican missionaries came then fifteen 96 under the leadership of juan de castro arrived and established the first dominican province 97 of the philippines and china thus consummating the hope expressed as early as 1579 98 in consultation with the other orders it was decided that the dominicans should be given the ministry of the territories of pangasinan and bataan which had theretofore been spiritually exploited by few priests almost immediately on september 15 1587 the vicariate of bataan was founded and settled in speaking of it aduarte stressed the importance of a knowledge of the language of the natives which there would have been tagalog to the success of the mission domingo de nieva one of the four members of the mission learned it rapidly and well and soon began to preach to the indians in their own tongue his aptitude for languages and its usefulness to the dominicans must have been very great for aduarte in listing the priests who originally volunteered in spain makes few comments about individuals but of nieva he remarks that he was afterwards of great importance because of the great ease and skill with which he learned languages whether indian or chinese 99 unfortunately nieva was only a deacon and so could not hear confession a fact which was greatly deplored because during that first year no other priest mastered the language sufficiently well to do it but in september 1588 he reached the requisite age and was ordained about that time the friars in bataanone had died and another was ailingwere joined by juan de la cruz who being young succeeded very well with the language 100 and also succeeded in surviving the climate early in 1588 juan cobo 101 arrived from mexico shortly thereafter on june 12 1588 the dominican chapter held its first convocation it elected juan de castro the first provincial adopted the general ordinances 102 already made in mexico gave the convent at manila the title of priory and designated as parts of the province four vicariates of primary importance was the appointment then of juan cobo to the mission for the chinese from the very earliest days of the spanish occupation of manila the governors had had trouble with the chinese and sangleys 103 these people had long conducted a profitable trade between china and the philippines and many had settled permanently near manila while others stayed there regularly between trading voyages the chinese merchants were in full control of the shops of the city and so monopolized retail trade that the early governors legislated 104 against them to give the spaniards a chance to establish themselves in business in 1588 there were as many as seven thousand of them in and around manila no one had objected to the pangasinan and bataan assignments but when it was suggested that the dominicans also assume the responsibility for the ministry over the chinese and sangleys in the suburbs of manila the augustinians vehemently resented what they considered an invasion of their prior rights aduarte omits any account of a disagreement merely saying that since the chinese had had no one to minister to them the dominicans assumed that responsibility but in a letter 105 from the licentiate gaspar de ayala to philip ii dated from manila july 15 1589 full details of the squabble are given from this source we learn that the augustinians had a convent in the village of tondo in the chinese district there they had ministered to the natives in their own language but had rather neglected their chinesespeaking parishioners consequently after the arrival of the dominicans the audiencia passed an ordinance requiring that the bishop appoint ministers of one order to administer to the chinese in their own language within thirty days to meet the deadline the augustinians began to study chinese at breakneck speed but when the bishop came to tondo to hear one of the friars who was supposed to know the language preach in it there was some trouble as a result of which the augustinian would not or indeed could not preach naturally when it was decided to award the territory to the dominicans the augustinians accused the bishop of favoritism towards his own order the whole situation is best described in the report on the chinese made by salazar to the king on june 24 1590 when i arrived in this land i found that in a village called tondowhich is not far from this city there being a river betweenlived many sangleys of whom some were christians but the larger part infidels in this city were also some shops kept by sangleys who lived here in order to sell the goods which they kept here year by year these sangleys were scattered among the spaniards with no specific place assigned to them until don gonzalo ronquillo allotted them a place to live in and to be used as a silkmarket which is here called parian of four large buildings here many shops were opened commerce increased and more sangleys came to this city when i came all the sangleys were almost forgotten and relegated to a corner no thought was taken for their conversion because no one knew their language or undertook to learn it on account of its great difficulty and because the religious who lived here were too busy with the natives of these islands although the augustinian religious had charge of the sangleys of tondo they did not minister to or instruct them in their own language but in that of the natives or this land thus the sangley christians living here were christians only in name knowing no more of christianity than if they had never accepted it then i appealed to all religious orders to appoint some one of their religious to learn the language and take charge of the sangleys although all of them showed a desire to do so and some even began to learn it yet no one succeeded and the sangleys found themselves with no one to instruct them and take up their conversion with the necessary earnestness until in the year eightyseven god brought to these islands the religious of st dominic 106 so we find as the dominicans undertook their mission a large settlement of chinese including both a settled and a floating population concentrated in the parian across the pasig river from the main city of manila the dominating figure of the chinese mission from the time of his arrival in the philippines was juan cobo in a letter written by him from the parian of manila july 13 1589 probably to ecclesiastical authorities in mexico he gives an account of the early days of the mission the order took a site next to this parian since there was not a single house between santo domingo and the parian and because of this opportunity the order presently charged itself with the chinese both christians and infidels and upon p fr miguel de benavides and p fr juan maldonado was imposed the responsibility for the care of the chinese and for learning their language p fr miguel was less occupied with other matters than fr juan maldonado so that he progressed in the language enough to begin to catechize in it this was the first year the order was in manila presently in the second year when i came the order moved p fr miguel and myself into another separate house at the other edge of the parian so that there stood between santo domingo and san gabriel which is the name of this church of the chinese the whole of the parian of the sangleys and there a poor little church was built under the protection of san gabriel to whom it fell by lot and a poor house where we two lived we entered into it at the beginning of september 1588 this was the first church for the chinese built and we believe that there is today not another parish church for the chinese but that and p fr miguel catechized them and preached to them in their chinese language and taught the doctrine in it i myself did not yet know the language but the lord has been served so that in a short time i progressed in it 107 the account of aduarte is not so accurate in some details but it supplies others not mentioned by cobo the first mission which benavides and maldonado or de san pedro martyr as he was later known built was near the village of tondo in a new settlement specially founded for christian chinese called baybay and it was named for our lady of the purification the second mission which was established by benavides and cobo was at first a palmleaf hut the name of san gabriel was decided upon by making lots with the names of various saints on them and then drawing san gabriel came out three times in a row and all were persuaded that the lord was pleased to have the patronage belong to this holy archangel soon because of the good works of the fathers who established a hospital there for the care of the sick and poor the demands upon the hut became so great that a larger building was planned at first it was to have been erected on the site of the hut but the inhabitants protested that a stone building so near native houses might do them great damage in the event of an earthquake so the friars went to the other side of the river and there built a temporary building of wood which was later completed in stone it was here then that the doctrina was printed in the church of san gabriel near the parian of manila at the edge of the chinese settlement under the care of benavides and cobo the mission flourished and the two fathers became increasingly proficient in the chinese language when the provincial juan de castro began making preparations for an inspection tour of his chinese vicariate in 1590 he chose as his companion miguel de benavides the account of the events leading up to this expedition is given in the already quoted letter of salazar on the chinese of the dominican religious who came to these islands four are engaged in ministering to the sangleys two of these four officiate in the church of san gabriel which together with the house where the religious live stands close to the parian another church with its house is on the promontory of baybay near tondowhich a river divides separating it from manila two of the four have learned the language of the sangleys so well and one of these two how to write also which is the most difficult part of the language that the sangleys wonder at their knowledge after due consideration of the matter the dominican fathers and myself decided that it was necessary to go to china thus we decided upon the departure sending at present no more than two religious fray miguel de benavides who was the first to learn the language of the sangleys and father juan de castro who came as vicar of the religious and who was made provincial here we preferred these two as one is well acquainted with the language and the other is much loved and esteemed by the sangleys on account of his venerable gray locks and blessed old age and we know that in that land old people are much respected and revered 108 they sailed on may 22 1590 but juan de castro before he left appointed cobo acting superior of the province with full authority during his absence and in the latters place as head of the chinese mission sent juan de san pedro martyr there is no doubt but that at this time benavides and cobo were the two outstanding chinese linguists among the spaniards in the philippines to benavides has been attributed 109 a chinese dictionary and schilling 110 uses the already quoted letter of cobo to prove that he also wrote a doctrina in chinese but granting that such works were written by him there is no evidence that they were written in chinese characters and not in chinese transliterated into roman letters the available evidence points to the fact that cobo was the only one who could then write in chinese characters salazar in his above quoted letter had said that one of these two have learned how to write also and in the same letter he continued fray juan cobo the dominican religiouswho as i have said before knows the language of the sangleys and their writing and who is most esteemed by themis sending to your majesty a book one of a number brought to him from china 111 further witness to cobos amazing knowledge of chinese writing is given by aduarte he knew three thousand chinese characters each different from all the rest for the chinese have no definite number of letters nor alphabet he translated a number of chinese books for like those of seneca though they are the work of heathens they contain many profound sayings like ours he taught astrology to some of them whom he found capable of learning and to bring them by all means to their salvation also taught them some trades that are necessary among spaniards but which not being used by the chinese they did not knowsuch as painting images binding books cutting and sewing clothes and such thingsdoing all to win men to god 112 finally as a more definite proof that cobo could have been the author of the chinese doctrina of 1593 we have the record 113 of a catecismo de la doctrina cristiana en lengua china written by him as well as many other works in chinese in may 1590 then the most accomplished sinologist yet to work in the philippines was in charge of the dominican province his first act wrote aduarte was to strengthen the ministry to the chinese by appointing to it father domingo de nieva a priest of great virtue and very ablewhich was tremendously important thereand one who best mastered that language as well as that of the indians in which he had had experience and he worked in both of them and wrote much to the great advantage of those who came after him 114 it is surprising that no previous writer has emphasized the presence of domingo de nieva whose proficiency in tagalog we have already noted at san gabriel during the years when the printing of the doctrinas must have been planned and executed his works are cited by fernandez 115 and after giving a summary of his career aduarte added he wrote much in the language of the indians and other things in the language of the chinese for whom he had printed in their language and characters a memorial upon the christian life with other brief tracts of prayer and meditation in preparation for the holy sacraments of confession and the sacred communion he was an enemy of sloth and so worked much in chinese in which he wrote a practically new grammar of the chinese language a vocabulary a manual of confession and many sermons in order that those who had to learn this language might find it less difficult 116 medina 117 records these various works as manila imprints of unknown date and to this indefinite information about them we can add nothing positive however it is apparent that some time before 1606 when nieva died on his way to mexico he had had books printed and since they were in chinese they must have been printed from woodblocks for at that early date it would have been impossible to have cast the number of characters necessary to print in chinese with movable type with nieva was maldonado or san pedro martyr he had been one of the first associates of benavides in the first chinese mission at baybay but after the arrival of cobo he had been sent by order of the first chapter to pangasinan when cobo was appointed acting provincial san pedro martyr was again assigned to the chinese ministry he had learned tagalog and after his return to the parian he learned more words of the chinese language than any other member of the order though he was not successful with the pronunciation 118 on may 31 1592 the governor received a letter from the emperor of japan demanding that an ambassador be sent to offer him the fealty of the philippines juan cobo as the best speaker of chinese was chosen to represent the spaniards and he left manila on july 29 1592 after successfully convincing the japanese emperor of the amity of the spaniards he left to come back to manila but his ship was wrecked in november on the coast of formosa and there cobo was killed by hostile natives meanwhile benavides had gone back to spain with bishop salazar in 1591 and did not return to the philippines until after his appointment as bishop of nueva segovia in 1595 that left as the only two remaining experts in the chinese language domingo de nieva and juan de san pedro martyr both of whom were at san gabriel in 1592 moreover both of them knew chinese and tagalog a text in tagalog was available based on the talaveraplasenciaoliver model which had circulated freely and this we believe was further editedhence the corrected by the religious of the ordersby these two dominicans in their editorial work they may have been helped by juan de la cruz who we have noted was sent to bataan in 1588 there learned tagalog and succeeded so perfectly with it that father fr francisco san joseph who was afterwards the best linguist there profited by the papers and labors of p fr juan de la cruz 119 juan de oliver the pioneer franciscan tagalist was still living and available for consultation and the polylingual jesuit francisco almerique also was in manila at the time a chinese text had been written by juan cobo and both nieva and san pedro martyr were capable of preparing this for publication again possibly aided by almerique and also diego munoz if as an augustinian he had been willing to cooperate with the dominicans nothing remained to be done but have the blocks cut and the impressions pulled the printing of the books the stage was set for the production of the doctrinas that there were chinese xylographic models upon which the books could be based is evidenced by the account of mendoza of the considerable number of chinese books brought to manila by martin de rada as early as 1575 a more likely model was a bilingual text in spanish and chinese which cobo describes in his letter of july 13 1589 where speaking of the jesuits in china he says moreover the father of the company who was in china wrote and printed in chinese letters a whole book of the unity of god the creation of the world and the commandments explained and in this book has gotten as far as the incarnation of the son of god concerning this i am not speaking of things heard for i have it and am thus certain of it as of all the things that happened how far i have progressed with the chinese letters i shall say later this book was printed in china in 1584 it circulates freely in china whence we have our copy and because of the writing contrary to what others have misleadingly said about the chinese they have done him no ill from which it may be inferred that the lion is not so wild as they paint him 120 there is no direct evidence to support our belief that it was during the brief period after castro returned probably late in 1590 and relieved cobo of his executive responsibilities and june 1592 when he left for japan that cobo began intensive plans for the production of bilingual texts his recorded interest in such books his influence with the chinese his energy and his own linguistic aptitude would naturally have stimulated him to undertake the task whether he actually began work on the blocks from which the books were printed or merely suggested the feasibility of the idea we do not know but we feel sure that juan cobo was the father of the production of books in the philippines there is no need here to go into the history of printing in china the method used there and its antiquity have been fully described by others 121 that there were chinese in manila who understood this ageold process would seem obvious from the reports of skilled craftsmen whose presence was noted by all the writers of the period we have already quoted a reference to juan cobos teaching them european trades and salazar in his already cited letter speaks of them further they are so skillful and clever that as soon as they see any object made by a spanish workman they reproduce it with exactness what arouses my wonder most is that when i arrived no sangley knew how to paint anything but now they have so perfected themselves in this art that they have produced marvelous works with both the brush and the chisel what has pleased all of us here has been the arrival of a bookbinder from mexico he brought books with him set up a bindery and hired a sangley who had offered his services to him the sangley secretly and without his master noticing it watched how the latter bound books and lo in less than lacuna in ms he left the house saying that he wished to serve him no longer and set up a similar shop 122 to turn over a manuscript copy of a book to a chinaman who had already some familiarity with the production of books in china or who with a given text could carve the blocks according to tradition was then not a matter of great difficulty there were chinese books which showed what the result would be there were spanish books definitely some from mexico which provided samples of european characters and format who cut the blocksthat is exactly what chinamanwe do not know nor do we know who handled the presswork but it is logical to assume that the whole process took place under the supervision of the fathers of san gabriel juan cobo if work had begun before 1592 and certainly nieva and san pedro martyr one further aide may have been the lay brother pedro rodriguez who had been sent to san gabriel with nieva and who was a handyman or skilled mechanic for aduarte credits him with rebuilding and restoring the hospital in speaking of the book printed for blancas de san jose aduarte said that the printing had been done by a chinaman a good christian 123 but in this particular account he does not give the chinamans name yet where he describes the founding of a second church of san gabriel in binondo sometime after march 28 1594 124 and before june 15 1596 when it was admitted to the chapter he tells in some detail of printing done by juan de vera 125 there have been in this town binondo then called minondoc many chinese of very exemplary lives juan de vera was not only a very devout man and one much given to prayer but a man who caused all his household to be the same he always heard mass and was very regular in his attendance at church he adorned the church most handsomely with hangings and paintings because he understood this art he also thinking only of the great results to be attained by means of holy and devout books gave himself to the great labor necessary to establish printing in this country where there was no journeyman who could show him the way or give him an account of the manner of printing in europe which is very different from the manner of printing followed in his own country of china the lord aided his pious intentions and he gave to this undertaking not only continued and excessive labor but all the forces of his mind which were great in spite of the difficulties he attained that which he desired and was the first printer in these islands and this not from avaricefor he gained much more in his business as a merchant and readily gave up his profitbut merely to do service to the lord and this good to the souls of the natives 126 it is interesting to note that this narrative which is in substance similar to that about the books of blancas de san jose nowhere mentions the name of the priest in connection with vera it is probable that juan de vera was as retana believed the first typographer and it may be that he also printed the doctrinas of 1593 it is impossible to say with certainty but it is not too fanciful to suppose that juan de vera tried xylographic printing under the supervision of nieva and san pedro martyr and after some experimenting achieved typography in the time of blancas de san jose since we have here dealt with a volume printed entirely from woodblocks it does not seem necessary to discuss in detail the subsequent typographical books however just as this goes to press a copy of the ordinationes generales prouintiae sanctissimi rosarij philippinarum 127 printed at binondo by juan de vera in 1604 has been discovered and also presented by mr rosenwald to the library of congress this is the volume described by remesal 128 as being printed in as fine characters and as correctly as if in rome or lyon no copy of the book had been described since his day although medina 129 and retana 130 both listed it from references which probably derived from remesal its discoveryalmost unbelievable coming so close on the heels of that of the doctrinahelps to close the gap between the latter and the two bataan imprints 131 of 1610 the arte y reglas de la lengva tagala and the librong pagaaralan nang manga tagalog nang uicang castilla the full story of the early typographical products of the philippines must wait upon another occasion for the questions posed by the scanty records and the handful of surviving books are extremely knotty where did the type come from medina suggested it was imported from macao retana believed it to have been cut in the philippines fernandez said that the first works of blancas de san jose were printed at bataan and the two 1610 books have that place of printing yet in 1604 the ordinationes issued from binondo remesal wrote that this book was printed by francisco de vera and the book itself bears the name of juan indeed the history of the early typographers and the output of their presses as it has so far been written presents many problems but they are problems which we feel are outside the scope of this study to summarize what we have learned of the earliest printing in the philippines we have the possibility but not a likely one that an arte by juan de quinones was printed xylographically in 1581 we know that in the first half of the year 1593 two doctrinas were printed xylographicallyalthough we have no way of telling which came firstone in tagalog from the talaveraplasenciaoliver text and one in chinese written by juan cobo both edited and printed under the supervision of domingo de nieva and juan de san pedro martyr we surmise that between 1593 and 1602 other works were also printed xylographically such as the small tracts of juan de villanueva and some of the books of blancas de san jose nieva and others and in 1602 was printed by juan de vera in all likelihood from movable type the book of our lady of the rosary by blancas de san jose the known facts are not many and we can only hope that time and further research will discover new ones to make the history of the earliest philippine imprints more

ihs unpublished ms of 1610 from which the present passage was quoted by retana col 25 for an account of the ms see santiago vela vi p 435n schilling p 214 demonstrates that according to the original punctuation the meaning is that the first printers were villanueva and blancas de san jose but with the shifting of a semicolon it could be read to mean that the first printers were of the order of st augustine we can see no reason to shift the semicolon and have retained it in its original place 16 retana col 26 said that he was able to find no information regarding villanueva except for the listing of his name by cano p 43 as having arrived in the philippines at an unknown date the destruction of the early records of the augustinians when the english sacked manila in 1762 accounts for

no doubt however but that hervas had a copy of the doctrina or accurate and extensive transcripts from a copy known to one of his friends 29 franz carl alter ueber die tagalische sprache vienna 1803 p

san agustin p 352 on pp 4434 referring to grijalva and herrera he says merely that quinones was very learned in the tagalog language and wrote a grammar and dictionary of it 35 he succeeded in learning that language with such perfection that he composed a treatise as a light and guide for the new missionaries and a vocabulary with which in a short time they could instruct those islanders in the mysteries of the faith medina p xxvii assumed that this referred to jose sicardo la cristiandad del japon madrid 1698 where he could find nothing about quinones but beristain cited specifically his historias de filipinas y japon which santiago vela vi p 441 thinks must be his additions to grijalva including a life of quinones which san agustin used and quoted from the quotation here is from san agustin p 442 where sicardo is given as the source 36 tomas de herrera alphabetvm avgvstinianvm madrid 1644 i p 406 according to p g p xxiv 37 schilling p 204 38 pedro bello noticia de los

the note on p xxiv we find that he there prints a law of the same content and date cited as law 3 title xxiv book 1 of the recopilacion where we have seen it with the extremely significant addition it shall not be published or printed or used if this phrase was not included in the original cedula sent to manila but added when printed as applying to all the indies it is important evidence that the king felt an admonition against printing unnecessary where no facilities for printing existed 41 retana col 10 cited from the original ms in the a of i 68142 torres ii no 3211 p 150 42 san antonio ii p 297 this work treated at length by san antonio is proof of the high esteem in which plasencia was held as a tagalist it was incorporated in a document of governor francisco tello dated july 13 1599

of so distinguished a student of the philippines because it shows how tangled and confused is the information concerning the primitive philippine press even among men best informed on the subject 46 medina nos 1 and 2 p 3 47 medina p xix 48 retana had published many of his findings in la politico de espana en filipinas madrid 189198 in his edition of joaquin martinez de zuniga estadismo de las

have already been cited 57 antonio palau y dulcet manuel del librero hispanoamericano barcelona 192337 iii p 72 58 schilling op cit 59 chirino p 3 writes that he was the first who made converts to christianity in the philippines preaching to them of jesus christ in their own tongueof which he made the first vocabulary which i have seen and studied and juan de medina who originally wrote his history in 1630 p 54 says that in visiting cebu in 1612 he saw a lexicon there compiled by father fray martin de rada which contained a great number of words grijalva op cit f 124v writes that rada by the force of his imaginative and excellent ability learned the visayan language as he had learned the otomi in this land mexico so that he could preach in it in five months 60 perez p 5 61 juan gonzalez de mendoza the historie of the great and mightie kingdom of china translated out of spanish by r parke london 1588 p 138 the original edition of 1585 said he made an arte y vocabulario we must take the phrase in few daies in a comparative sense but that an augustinian probably rada knew some chinese as early as july 30 1574 is shown by a letter from governor lavezaris to the king from manila sending him a map of the whole land of china with an explanation which i had some chinese interpreters make through the aid of an augustinian religious who is acquainted with the elements of the chinese language b r iii p 284 from the original ms in the a of i 6766 torres ii no 1868 p 1011 antonio de leon pinelo epitome de la biblioteca oriental i occidental nautica i geographica madrid 1629 p 31 also records radas chinese grammar and dictionary santiago vela vi pp 44460 gives a full history of rada and his writings he went to china a second time in may 1576 and in 1578 accompanied la sande on his expedition to borneo dying on the way back to manila in june of that year 62 gonzalez de mendoza op cit pp 1035 63 diego ordonez vivar came to the philippines in 1570 filled various ministries there and according to agustin maria de castro was in japan in 1597 where he witnessed the martyrdom of the franciscans he died in 1603 perez p 10 juan de medina p 74 says father diego de ordonez learned this language tagalog very quickly alonso alvatado had been on the unsuccessful 1542 expedition of villalobos and returned to the philippines in 1571 perez p 11 records that he became familiar with the tagalog language was the first prior of tondo ministered to the chinese there and was the first spaniard to learn the mandarin dialect he was elected provincial in 1575 and died at manila the following year jeronimo marin came to the islands with alvarado acquired skill in the visayan tagalog and chinese languages accompanied rada on his first expedition to china was in tondo in 1578 and later returned to spain to recruit new missionaries for the province dying in mexico in 1606 perez pp 1112 64 cano p 12 santiago vela i p 85 expresses the opinion that canos statement was an overenthusiasm and is not valid 65 retana col 9 66 juan de medina p 156 67 santiago vela i p 85 where he cites the first book of the gobierno of the augustinian province 68 santiago vela i pp 846 treats of the whole question in detail 69 a doctrina in tagalog attributed to alburquerque by agustin maria de castro in his unpublished osario is said by santiago vela i p 85 to have been arranged and perfected by quinones and was probably that presented by him to the synod of 1582 if indeed he did present such a work then for an account of the ms osario see schilling p 205n 70 perez p 20n quotes vicente barrantes el teatro tagalo madrid 1890 p 170 as saying that according to the augustinian writers alburquerque compiled an arte de la lengua tagala between 1570 and 1580 the manuscript of which disappeared when the english sacked manila in 1762 it may be that barrantes referred to cano or possibly castro but it must be emphasized that no contemporary historian as far as has been discovered up to this time has made such a statement 71 quinones came to the philippines in 1577 and spent his time in missions in and about manila he was named prior of manila in 1586 and provincial vicar in 1587 in which year he died perez p 19 and santiago vela vi pp 4334 72 again castro as cited by santiago vela vi p 435 is the only authority for this although san agustin p 391 lists quinones name among those present at the synod 73 san agustin p 381 it should be noted that this statement is in direct contradiction to those we shall cite later in connection with the controversy between the augustinians and dominicans over the chinese ministry the convent at tondo had been founded in 1571 so san agustin here must refer specifically to the chinese mission 74 perez p 22 75 perez p 29 76 huerta pp 443 50001 in 1580 under the influence of plasencia talavera took the habit of the franciscan order and preached throughout the philippines until his death in 1616 huerta lists six works in tagalog by him all of them devotionary tracts the last of which he notes was printed at manila in 1617 and is listed by medina no 20 pp 145 his works are also recorded by leon pinelo op cit 173738 ii f 919r 77 santa ines written originally in 1676 p 211 virtually the same information is given by san antonio i pp 5323 563 78 juan de la concepcion historia general de philipinas manila 178892 ii pp 456 schilling p 203n maintains that the early writers were mistaken in believing that the synod was held in 1581 on october 16 1581 the bishop called a meeting of ten priests at the convent of tondo to discuss the execution of the decree about slaves torres ii pp cxlivv no laymen were present and no other topic was discussed the decisions of this meeting were sent in a letter from salazar to the king dated from tondo october 17 1581 translated in b r xxxiv pp 32531 from the original ms in the a of i 68142 torres ii no 2686 p 95 the following year a real synod was held this time including lay government officials as well as priests at which was discussed a variety of subjects robert streit bibliotheca missionum aachen 1928 iv pp 32731 cites a ms account of it by the jesuit father sanchez who was present and valentin marin ensayo de una sintesis de los trabajos realizados por las corporaciones religiosas espanoles de filipinas manila 1901 i pp 192 et seqq cites another ms then in the archives of the archiepiscopal palace of manila memoria de una junta que se hizo a manera de concilio el ano de 1582 para dar asiento a las cosas tocantes al aumento de la fe y justificacion de las conquistas hechas y que adelante se hicieron por los espanoles from which he quotes extensively with reference to the synod see further lorenzo perez origen de las misiones franciscanas en el extremo oriente in archivo iberoamericano 1915 iii pp 386400 79 santa ines p 212 again similar accounts are to be found in san antonio i pp 5636 in far more detail and phrased in even more laudatory terms and the fullest early biography of plasencia is given by san antonio ii pp 51279 modern surveys appear in marin op cit ii pp 57382 and lorenzo perez op cit pp 378 et seqq 80 chirino primera parte quoted by retana col 24 implied that quinones and plasencia wrote at about the same time the first who wrote in these languages were in visayan p fr martin de rada and in tagalog fr juan de quinones both of the order of st augustine and at the same time fr juan de oliver and fr juan de plasencia of the order of st francis of whom the latter began first but the former wrote many more things and very useful ones however san antonio i p 532 wrote perhaps with bias in favor of his own order although the augustinian fathers had come earlier and did not lack priests fluent in the idiom the language had not yet been reduced to a grammar so that it could be learned by common grammatical rules nor was there a general vocabulary of speech except that each one had his own notes to make himself understood and everything was unsystematized 81 entrada de la seraphica religion de nuestro p s francisco en las islas philipinas ms of 1649 first published in retana archivo i no iii translated in b r xxxv p 311 82 medina p 15 quoting from martinez whom we are unable to trace 83 huerta pp 4923 oliver died in 1599 san antonio ii p 531 says that plasencia was the first to write a catechism called in tagalog tocsohan and oliver was the first to translate the explanation of the doctrina olivers works are noted by leon pinelo op cit 173738 ii col 730 and barrantes op cit p 187 84 sebastian de totanes arte de la lengua tagala manila 1850 p v first edition printed in 1745 says of oliver that up to the present day our province reveres him as the first master of this idiom 85 see note 42 86 huerta p 517 nothing is known of diego de la asuncion except that he wrote five works in tagalog including an arte and diccionario huerta was unable to find any record of him in the mission lists the capitularies or the death records but that he was in the philippines before 1649 we can be sure of from the notice of him in the manuscript of that date 87 huerta p 495 montes y escamilla came to the islands in 1583 and remained there until his death in 1610 five works in tagalog are attributed to him an arte diccionario confesionario devocional tagalog and a guia de pecadores the devocional is listed by medina no 16 p 12 88 pablo rojo fr juan de plasencia escritor appendix 3 of santa ines ii p 590 an early reference by fernandez historia eclesiastica p 300 speaking of the franciscan missionary successes among the natives says they learned the doctrina christiana which the priests translated into tagalog 89 rojo in santa ines ii pp 5901 says that the doctrina then being used among the tagalogs was the same as that written by plasencia except for modernization in accordance with the changes which had taken place in the language since his time 90 medina no 15 p 11 91 chirino p 14 92 colin ii p 325 93 chirino p 27 94 chirino chaps xvxvii pp 3441 95 on may 13 1579 philip ii wrote to the governor of the philippines fray domingo de salazar of the dominican order and bishop of the said islands has reported to us that he is going to reside in these islands and that he will take with him religious of his order to found monasteries and to take charge of the conversion and instruction of the natives b r iv p 141 translated from the original ms in the archivohistorico nacional cedulario indico t 31 f 132v no 135 twelve of the twenty who set out from europe with salazar died before reaching mexico and the others were so sick that all but one remained there so when salazar landed at manila in march 1581 he was accompanied by twenty augustinians eight franciscans and only one dominican christoval de salvatierra 96 for these and other general facts i have used aduarte and remesal where they are supported by the other historians juan de la concepcion san antonio san

the appointment already obtained from pablo constable de ferrara general of the dominican order making juan chrisostomo vicargeneral of the philippine islands and china and giving him authority to establish a province there b r v pp 199200 translated from hernaez coleccion de bulas brussels 1879 i p 527 where it is printed from the original ms in the vatican bular dom t 15 p 412 98 in 1580 the dominicans of mexico had begun plans for the establishment of a province in the orient and sent juan chrisostomo to europe to obtain the necessary permission from lay and ecclesiastical authorities the jesuit alonso sanchez who had been sent to spain to explain the situation in the philippines was at court and told the king and council of the indiesquite subverting his missionthat there was no need for more priests and particularly no need for a new order there chrisostomo was discouraged but the scheme was revivified by juan de castro who finally secured a letter from philip ii on september 20 1585 endorsing the plan twentytwo volunteers sailed from spain on july 17 1586 in mexico the dominicans again found sanchez propagandizing against the mission and also encountered the efforts of the viceroy to persuade the friars to remain there notwithstanding twenty friars subscribed to a set of ordinances at the convent of santo domingo in mexico on december 17 1586 of the twenty fifteen went to the philippines three went directly to china and juan chrisostomo who was ill and weak and juan cobo who had business there stayed behind in mexico 99 aduarte i p 9 100 aduarte i p 70 101 juan cobo had stayed behind in mexico on business and during his stay had been so moved by the scandals of the government there that he preached publicly against them as a result of which he was banished by the viceroy he brought with him from mexico a fellowreformer and exile luis gandullo and four other recruits for the philippine mission 102 these are printed in the ordinationes of 1604 see note 127 and by remesal pp 6778 who says that these ordinances were printed in as fine characters and as correctly as if in rome or lyon by francisco de vera a chinese christian in the town of binondo in the year 1604 through the diligence of fr miguel martin 103 sangley a term used by the natives to designate chinese was derived from the cantonese hiang or xiang and ley meaning a travelling merchant it was adopted by the spaniards and in most instances used interchangeably with chinese if any distinction existed it was that a sangley was a permanent resident of the philippinesquite contrary to the derivation of the wordor a chinese of partially native blood see san agustin p 253 104 particularly the memorial to the council of the indies sent with sanchez april

first chinese catechism in the philippines he does not however differentiate between writing in chinese characters and writing transliterated chinese and moreover hizo doctrina may only mean that he taught the doctrine not necessarily that he wrote one 111 b r vii p 238 as in note 106 112 aduarte i p 140 113 aduarte i p 140 says before the previously quoted passage that cobo put the doctrina

settlement to a new site directly across the river where land was given them by don luis perez dasmarinas the son and successor of gomez perez dasmarinas and there a second church of san gabriel was built according to an inscription on a painting of don luis exhibited at the st louis fair of 1904 and illustrated in b r xxx p 228 he bought the land from don antonio velada on march 28 1594 so that san gabriel of minondoc could not have been the place where the 1593 volumes were printed marin op cit ii p 617 says that san gabriel was moved several years after its foundation to binondo at the request of the city and was rebuilt twice it is apparent that san gabriel in the parian was abandoned after the church in binondo was built 125 juan de vera was probably a comparatively common name at this time because upon baptism the natives and chinese assumed any spanish name they pleased and since santiago de vera was governor from 1584 to 1590 his last name would have been very popular
