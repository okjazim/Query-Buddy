flaxius and the bookseller flaxius in the future the evanishment of flaxius breitmann’s last ballad first words the raison d’être cause for existence and origin of this book may be found in the following extract from a review of the florentine legends which appeared in the daily chronicle of june 19 1895 ‘mr leland frequently refers throughout his narratives to a certain flaxius we were somewhat puzzled as to whom this flaxius might be until we came across the statement that the author had once begun a book entitled the experiences of flaxius the immortal the reflections of the immortal are quoted extensively in this volume and we can only say we wish the flaxius project a happy ending and would not be surprised if the new sage racy of italian soil as he appears to be should even a little eclipse mr leland’s old hero of lager beer celebrity’ for which kind word all thanks and from the heart since it suggested what had never been seriously thought of for in truth the experiences had no more been written than the books which appear in the catalogue of the library given in the chronicle of pantagruel now i have had all my life a strange love for works on varied subjects in unity of style even as in mendelssohn’s songs without words there are many melodies forming one work such were the best sketches of irving and such was my first original venture meister karl’s sketchbook which had the remarkable fortune to attract most unexpectedly a very kind letter on it from washington irving and subsequently another of seven large closely written pages critical and laudatory from lord bulwer lytton the novelist who with all modesty be it said took several palpable hints from it for his kenelm chillingly into which he introduced me under a pseudonym as a small memento and it is in this style that the present work is composed of different stories which however make one parure or changing the metaphor of varied dishes in one dinner met i beg the reader to pardon this fond disquisition but it is natural for an author to think fondly of his first work as it is for a mother to do the same by her firstborn and i was the more influenced to do so by its having been in the same genre as the present volume the comparison made by the reviewer of the chronicle between the warriorbard hans breitmann and his possible rival flaxius suggested the idea of making the two meet in this volume the result of which encounter is two breitmann ballads never before published with others which had indeed appeared casually in another form but not as yet in any edition of the poems and which will be assuredly new to most of my readers and as these later laysof which i have only given a specimenall turn on marvellous mediæval legends of magic i will mention by way of avantcourier that i have in manuscript and have been writing or revising this thirty years a curious collection of ballads of witchcraft and songs of sorcery which i cannot but think would greatly please all lovers of occulta and which will be published should sign be given that it would be wanted by the public i would end by recording that this work is most kindly and cordially dedicated to certain friends who have greatly aided me at different times in collecting italian folklore that is to say to miss roma lister who was from the first specially interested in flaxius and to mrs tessa arbuthnot whereunto i might add the names of all who have for many years and in many ways shown friendship and cordial kindnessof late in sad trials by illnessto whom be all thanks charles godfrey leland florence june 1902 flaxius and the fairy or how he became an immortal ‘this work is a collection of fables’sir roger lestrange ‘there is no expression of politeness but has its root in the moral nature of man’goethe ‘there is no policy like politeness and a good manner is the best thing in the world either to get a good name or to supply the want of it’bulwer lytton ‘politeness is like generosity nay i am not sure that it is not generosity itself but neither deserves respect unless perfectly innateunaffected and natural’l’accademia long ago when time was in its early dawnà prima pueritia or in its pink infancyflaxius the neophyte was also in his youth for which reason he and the world got on very well together he was far from having attained to high magic though of an eminently respectable old priestlysorcering family and of fairy descent but he had in him those qualities which in any age advance the man who gets a fair trial and that we may the better understand what these qualities were i will narrate the first bud of incident or rosy adventure by which it befell that he too rose in life it happened one day that on the annual holiday or festival of volterra in the first etruscan age lied about by inghirami flaxius saw in the street among the many in the middle distance a girl who was à prima vista evidently not respectable or was rather so far from it that it might not have been said habet pudicitiam in propatulo yet there was nothing arrogantly offensive in the poor thing she seemed to be of that kind whose whole life like the donkey’s is a sad mute speech to the effect ‘if you don’t care for meand i’m not astonished that you don’tthen don’t speak to me but pray do not abuse me for i can’t help itindeed i can’t’ this silentviolet eloquence was however lost on a group of two or three rude young men and girls who came howling along in high redpoppy spirits and who seeing the poor forlorn creature proceeded to hoot her in the manner peculiar to the virtuous vulgar of all ages by hurling at her terms intended to make her feel deeply that she was indeed that which her sad attire proclaimed her to be ‘and out of the way of your betters o dirt and into the dirt’ cried a youth giving a bump to the moral calamity which sent her reeling so that she indeed fell in the mud of the street at which all roared with laughter now in all the country round there was not a taller or more robust bull of a young man than flaxius and seeing this he gave the guardian or vindicator of morals and holy virtue a blow which levelled him likewise in the grey dirt and with as little difficulty sent the rest flying for there was that in his patrician appearance quite as much as in his iron strength which inspired fear he picked up the girl bade her be of good cheer and not mind what had happened there was something marvellously moving and honeycomforting in his tone of voice which snatched a grace beyond the reach of skill it is an art little known now to the world that of the voice trained to woo and win feeling to inspire awe and emotion by musical tonebut it formed a part of cultured magic in early times and flaxius was at the head of the class in enchanting natural elocution and musical morality and furthermore bestowed on her a silver coin and was about to depart when the girl astonished him by saying in tones as marked and deeply magical as his own ‘why did you pity me’ flaxius replied ‘because you doing no one injustice were unjustly treated’ ‘do you not see what i am’ ‘i see nothing beyond what i behold in all human beings one cast by fate or chance into a certain life and few indeed are what they fain would be’ ‘then you despise no one’ ‘i very deeply despise all who make no effort to know or do what is better i despise all who can onlyi say onlyrealise their own dignity in the abasement of others i despise the man who requires to own slaves in order to know that he is free i feel’ ‘there are not many who feel as you do’ replied the girl and this time in the voice flaxius recognised that he was indeed speaking to a magia or one of the initiated in high wisdom therefore he was not astonished to see in her eyes a strange and as yet unperceived expression of marvellous intellect and electric beauty and note a divine dignity and grace in her carriage she signed to him to follow her and he obeyed ‘no there are yet few’ he answered ‘but there will ever be more and more in the ages to come i would that i could live to see the time when all slavery and social injustice will disappear but will it ever be’ ‘who knows’ replied his companion ‘who knows how long we may live or how bad or good the world may become or anything’ ‘do not the gods know’ said flaxius amazed ‘who knows what the gods know’ replied the magia ‘they do not even know what they know themselves’ by this high time the pair had passed as if by enchantment or in a dream into a strange mountain country unknown to flaxius wilder grew the rocks and road until they came to a marvellous place where the cliffs were like a vast range of rude castles all in one as they approached flaxius saw them change to magnificent ancient structures then they entered a golden door and soon were in a splendidly furnished apartment the magia was now a being of unearthly beauty robed in light before her flaxius forgotit is to be desired that modern realists would do the sameeven the transcendental upholstery ‘remarkable young man’ said the beautiful being pray be it noted by the reader that all the phrases here given are far more poetic in etruscan ‘i have brought you hither on important business’ ‘at your command daughter of the most beautiful’ replied flaxius this was a delicate compliment according to magic for it was from a high formula of worship and was therefore tenderly blasphemous in the genitive the lady smiled subjectively not with her face but in her intonation as she replied in the ablative absolute ‘know that i was this day what i was for being what those were who insulted me and truly in being every whit as base as they’ ‘this is a kind of poem’ reflected flaxius a great many of the lyrics of that age were riddles like some of the songs and not a few of the novelettes of the present time to say nothing of browning ‘i was doing a deserved penance from which you rescued me listen i was born of the fairy race but by long study penance and prayer to the sublimities rose to the higher order of spirits beyond which are the minor gods such as those to whom the great deities assign specialties in nature or even in mortal life my protectress was thana the chaste goddess of the moon or diana and as power was to be gained by renouncing pleasure i became proud of maiden virtue believing it was a virtue in itself and not one of the means thereto’ ‘more and more interesting’ reflected flaxius ‘and a neat distinction’ ‘and one day in my vanity i insulted one of the beautiful attendants on turan or venus the goddess of beauty and love for i reviled a lasa or one of the spirits who are attendants on and mistresses of the souls which come from earth yes i insulted her much as i was this day insulted by the mob there was an appeal to the gods and tinia the lord of all sentenced me to assume the mortal form in which you today first beheld me and to endure the insults of men till i should learn higher truth and until i should meet with a mortal who would treat me sincerely with true humanity this i have done and now i am not only freed from penance but find myself advanced far beyond what i wasgoing in golden glory ever on yet i say in truth that i did not suffer once or in the least as a mortal from the time that i was struck by the great truth in all its branches that no one should be condemned for being what one is by fate and that inferno is not too bad for a prurient prude on the prowl ‘but to you who were in this my master i owe great gratitude by penance and prayer i have accumulated much power which i proposed to devote to advancing myself to higher lives but it shall go to you in the form of two wishes i can wait for more and work a while longer ask for whatever you can imagine such as a mortal may requirewealth or power choose’ ‘your ladyship’ replied flaxius ‘is decidedly determined to prove that in this world the less a man does the better he is paid for it having been already rewarded a millionfold by the sight of your superb beauty for what i declare in all sincerity seems to me to be a mere little street incident in which i casually comported myself as a simply decent man should i am of course to receive further recompense beyond all human conception ’tis the rule so be it yet i pray you most beautifully grateful do not ascribe it to modesty or virtue if i am not extravagant in my desire i have heard of a man who having been offered a wish by a god forthwith wished that his future wishes might all be granted cunning that and they were all granted so that in the end he became the most miserable creature on earth and ended by wishing himself to the devil and got there as must befall most mortals who get all they want now as you o beyondalldreams are inconceivably my superior in wisdom it occurs to me that a single wish guided by your sagacity would be more to my benefit than a thousand emanating from my weak mind therefore for a beginning i wish that your divine loveliness would kindly tell me what my second wish should be’ ‘there is in that wish’ replied the spirit ‘a combination of generosity courtesy and gratitude such as a firstclass god need not be ashamed of well i will choose for you a wish that would suit few men you shall live on earth a philosopher but ever in manly strength and health as long as you will and to the end of time if you choose it you will see and feel so deeply into natureas i can well foreseethat the passing away of other mortals races or kingdoms will be but as the passing away of other guests from a hostelry or as clouds from the sky for to such as you are o humorist to live on earth or in heaven amid ghosts or gods would in the end be all one and the same you would note it all with curious observation and be the same unchanged in every age for to him who has like unto thee attained to seeing things absolutely as they aregods or geese are all one and the same’ ‘what a stupendous truth’ thought flaxius ‘and how beautifully expressed i could go on listening to this lady till i should grow thirstyfor fame’ ‘and they are all one and the same’ continued the spiritlady ‘to him who is honestwhich always means generous they are all one and the same to the upright or charitable how do you like your gift’ ‘i am delighted o my eyes beyond all expression and now see how wise i was to trust to your higher wisdom to tell the truth o diva i was dreadfully afraid lest your grace might bestow on me wealthi detest businessunbounded dominion ineffable winsomeness æsthetic tasteo rubbishgratified ambitiono emeticsand powernot being i trust a cad for to tell the truth i was fearfully afraid of all earthly blessings and so as to secure the least of evils resolved to take but one as i was in politeness bound not to decline your offer of sugarplums and therefore choose what it seems best to you to give’ ‘you are o philosopher’ replied the spirit ‘so ingenious in your generosity that you make yourself almost discourteous man i read your heart and know that you are no more free from desire than are the gods for to wish for nothing is to live no more now will i hold you firmly and give you more whether you will or not thy first wish was no wish at all o flaxius it was but a kindly gift to me to spare my power and aid me on my road to higher life therefore a wish still remains to thee and i warn thee that the favours of the gods are not to be lightly cast aside therefore make a wish now for thyself and look that thou put into it all thy heart and all thy self’ ‘then lady’ replied flaxius ‘since i must ask for something i wish to know in what manner i can best show my gratitude to you for all this kindness’ ‘go thy way for an incorrigible rogue’ exclaimed the spirit this time with a divinely genial smile on her countenance ‘i see that thou wilt never be beaten at this game ages on ages hence when thou may’st take a fancy to leave the world there shall be inscribed on thy tomb “here lies flaxius never surpassed among men or gods in generosity courtesy or coolness”’ ‘and the gratitude o marvellous one’ exclaimed flaxius ‘thou canst show it best by remaining here as my guest and regarding my house as a home when weary of wandering about in the wide world come here and rest and ever be welcome here no haunting hintial or spirit of the shadow can cast a gloom over life in these fairy palaces all is peace ‘but remember flaxius’ added the beautiful spirit ‘that it is still not too late for thee to express and receive another wish by the eternal law of the aesir this must be done within the fated favourable hour when a spirit offers it opportunity is golden and i ask it as a favour’ ‘then your resplendent picturesqueness and benign benevolence’ replied flaxius quoting at haphazard what he could recall from the etruscan prayerbook and grasping desperately in earnest at the first thing he could think of which would be nice to have or to be ‘make me an original character’ the peri of loveliness raised the two most beautiful little hands which flaxius had ever seen and slightly spreading the rosy fingers struck them downwards abruptly even as mortals do when they ‘give it up’ in mild despair and are deadlocked grassed or gravelled ‘i hope i utter no blasphemy against the power of the immortals’ said the beautiful one ‘but i verily believe the gods themselves o flaxius can add nothing to thee as thou art in that respect o tinia father of the deities ineffable overwhelming and unspeakable fulminator’ she exclaimed with the passion of a wildly inspired divinity ‘am i not right and if so give me a sign that i speak the truth my destiny what can one do with such a man’ over all northern italy there roared such a peal of thunder as the oldest aruspices or lucumones had never heard before it rang in rome and rolled beyond the alps vesuvius by fair parthenopis answered it with the tremendous peal of an eruption as vulcan termed sethlans the earthly deity of fire answered his awful brother of the air it drove the gods of the fields and roads the fairies and satyrs silvani fauns dusii and all their kind in terror to the mountain caves and forests it pierced like a spirit to the depths of the darkest caverns wherein reposed the ancestors and the dead amid the painted vases and mystic bronzes turned over in their eternal sleep and every statue in the land was found next morning in a changed position or bottom upwards the magi consulted the ars fulguritora written of yore by the nymph begoe to translate the mighty peal for unto them its words were a distinct language and as they overturned the holy utterance syllable by syllable from the dictionary into etruscan it read ‘fear not o daughter for thou speakest truth that is about the size of it in sooth for well i ween on earth no queerer cus did ever live than this thy flaxius’ cus be it observed is a terminal noun signifying a person of any kindas rusticus grammaticus clericus and many other kinds of cussesits use here being a proof of the immense antiquity of the sabine latin version of the original from which this tale is taken ab hac origine et itinere terrestri illuc profectus est‘’twas thus that flaxius got his start in life’ ab hoc disce‘learn from his legend this’ concludes the scroll ‘be it a slipper or be she a shrew be civil to women whatever you do’ flaxius and the god ‘every divinityno matter who is but the ideal of an age or race which makes its god though it be not with hands just in the form which it would like to wear and every man in this is like his age’ ages have passed away since flaxius found himself one twilight in autumn in the wild lombard land of northern italy towering far as eye could see vast cliffs or mighty peaks sprang up like living forms with precipiced sides falling gracefully as classic draperies bold and strange and all unlike the rounded hills and undulating plains of other countries before him spread as if into a steelblue eternity the shining mediterranean all about him seemed beautiful cold and strange as in a dream the western sky was one even hue of rich ripe orange turning into brown upon a distant headland rose an ancient tower by which rested a vessel with one long sloping sail a chill stole o’er the whispering breeze and the evening star shone gently forth and standing there high upon the mountain the mystic magian and undying one looked around among the rocks and said ‘here it was that the fairy who is so obliging as to rule my destiny as yonder star is said to rule the heart bade me come at dated day and hour to meet with one whose acquaintance as she assured me would prove to be remarkably interesting truly with all my utmost stretch of thought be it in levelled prose or rolling poetry i can conjure up nothing personal here or make any spiritual bread out of these stones but then ’tis only purblind ignorance which vows that all is nothing which it cannot see now as there is no form near me and as i can with sorcerer’s sight see for fifty miles adown and all around the land and sea i opine that he the beloved personage to keep the tryst must come here on the wings of thought far sweeping light of my soul i give thee half an hour’ but as flaxius made this last remark he observed a cypress plant about six feet high with leafage reaching to the ground a furlong distant on a cliff was evidently moving from its place towards him and as it moved was growing human in its form the head became distinct the shoulders next then the lower foliage unfolded in a long dark robe like all illuminatisuch as you and iflaxius drew critical philosophical deductions first before examining vulgar details in these words ‘i wonder now whether the seeing saplings waving in the wind did not first suggest to man ghosts but this is really a being fairy mine i did not think that thou wouldst play a miracle on me thaumaturgy among us is really too bad but perhaps’ he added ‘it is a fancy of the gentleman himselfhabit becomes strict nature with us all’ as the form drew near him flaxius recognised in the face and mien of the stranger though it would not be apparent to the world a gymnosophist so they were once termed whom we should call brahminsthat is indian sages evidently the stranger had come far astray into the italian land now as flaxius had passed a century or two of his youth in company with his friend pythagoras in study at the leading indian universities he understood the stranger at a glance therefore he addressed him familiarly in romany which is a cousin to hindi which is a granddaughter to sanskrit and therefore all in the family and generally spoken ‘latcho divvus prala būt mishto hom dikàv tute’ ‘good day brother right glad i am to see thee’ but the stranger gravely replied in the mother of sanskrit or ancient aryan of the tertiary period ‘i am of older race than thou hast deemed i was among the fathers of those who first came into india from the far north and i speak the tongue which is destined in its descendants to encircle the whole world and thou too knowest it flaxius as i know thee for we have met ere now long since beyond the ganges though thou now speakest flippantly like a mad college youth in the language of the roads but thou art only a boy as yet in years and wilt learn wisdom in time and the fairy who watches over thee has sent me here that thou mayst have a lesson which will profit thee so far as thou art wise and redouble what there is in thee be it small or great and mend thy flippant speech’ to which flaxius humbly and gently replied in good sanskrit ‘few indeed o father are the diamond dewdrops of immortality which have fallen into my vase from the infinite heaven of wisdom barely the flavour of a taste of the amrecta cup of true knowledge has come to me from the depth of the soundless sea of truth and if thou canst add to it ever so little it will be most gratefully received i am as one who murmurs feebly in a sleep mid broken dreams i pray thee waken me to life and light’ ‘it is not from me flaxius’ answered the aryan sage ‘that thy lesson is to come but from one nearer allied to thee in that philosophy of life which thou art next to learn my footsteps wander in the silent paths far beyond humanity and the visible scope of sense thine have not yet trodden all the ways of the world in which thou hast a part as yet for thee there is perfume in the green valleys amid violets and asphodel for thee birds still sing in leafy trees for thee the lovely nymph amid the reeds still smiles and beckons with a cautious air and brave men welcome thee with the winecup in the weaponed hall for thee is yet the ring and the crash of arms and the joy of battle and council among sages and kings all of this i have left far behind mefor it was my fate whether to press on through the ages or exhaust the age ere leaving it is not a question for us to every one let his road and ours be plain ‘now as to him whom thou art here to meet here in this land as indeed in many others long ere thy etruscan ancestors had brought egyptian and greek art or culture into their own rude strength and tremendous superstition and faith in ancient forms there were men who after death became spirits and were worshipped as gods yet even then so inherent was earth in their natures they remained of the world worldly and existed in that nature which we of india ever aspire to transcend among them was one who vowed never to quit this world and human life till he had mastered its last secret’ ‘a most original and glorious god that’ observed flaxius ‘and one rather to my mind was he think you square right or round wrong’ ‘being assumedly in his right mind he did nothing wrong’ answered the aryan ‘nay there is a point to come in the dim and remote future where our paths will meet but to the god himself look about thee and tell me what thou seest’ ‘i behold’ replied flaxius after a pause ‘vast rocks or remnants as it seems on closer look of some tremendous architecture of long lost ages of rudest form yet worked with giant will so worn by time and so tossed in confusion that few would trace in them the hand of man i myself did not at first observe that these were ruins of some massy building’ ‘what modern culture would not note’ replied the aryan ‘has however been retained in popular tradition for the wild shepherd who pastures his goats amid these rocks or the old crones while spindling in their shade record in what has been called the “gospel of the distaff” tales of a time when there was a mighty temple in this spota marvellous building of high walls and towers from whose lofty summit men beheld the sun while it was still dark on earth or as legend grows in greatness all night long this tale their ancestors brought from the icy north where indeed it is true enough in a way and ever will be ‘therein dwelt the god who had been a mighty man uniting in himself all that was of the earth earthy of human craft most crafty of strength the strongest of honeyed sweetness the most sweet of mortal bitterness the bitterest he gave himself unto the very life of the life of what the egyptian hermes has called the downwardborne elements of god but suffered not a fibre a breath of that which transcends lifeor what we call the spiritual or divineto mingle with or enter into his sphere hence dealing only with material things he found that all things material do somewhere clash or fail and that however high human thoughts may rise there is always some higher point whence they appear as mockeries and failures or foolish incompletions he endedsupposing an endby seeing in all things that which beginning as almost senseless fun and witless laughter in apes and boors rises to humour and true wit in culture flits as the paradox o’er many a problem of life thrills or charms or terrifies as contrast or contradiction in the struggle of forces appals and bewilders us in the agony and suffering pain and tragedy of the elements and man and ends all in death and new birth to him in all is one stupendous humour whether in laughter or in weeping or in the deepest human wisdomfor in all lies the paradox always visible from some point to the god’ ‘verily’ observed flaxius ‘that is having a keen perception of a joke on a tremendous scale and considering that all nature hath as yet appeared to me as consisting principally of conundrums i should infer that our god will find no lack of work or of amusement for some time to come truly i begin to surmise that there is more wisdom in the world than the wisest are aware of and that the greater we become the greater are our jests and the more poetic our quodlibets yea and that even a pun may be so sublime that a church may be founded on it it has indeed occurred to me many a time that many a doctrine creed or law divine for which myriads of lives have been lost is all bosh as ye say in your ancient indian tongue ‘mere noise and nonsense’ like bricks set in a row on end by children they only knock one another down in due succession at the last ‘therefore humour in its highest and holiest or most diabolical sense is the one true aurea catena or golden chain which runs through all things so far as man can know them yes it is like a tremendous rock which i once saw even in thy native land o sage it overhung the road so terribly that the heart of him who passed under it quaked with fear but when it was passed men looking backwards beheld that in the sunshine it wore the form of a great grotesque face beaming with winky laughter’ ‘thou dost indeed rise to the occasion flaxius’ replied the sage with an expression which seemed almost like the reflected faraway dim phantom of a prehistoric smile it was his first for seven hundred and fiftythree years reckoning from the fifteenth of august which is the ascension day of buddha ‘almost thou persuadest me that the god has a convert readybaked to his hand but it is past the sunset and i know that we are awaited follow me’ he led the way along a winding path or easy footway now beside vast uplifted stones now by the edges of tremendous cliffs at whose base far below was heard the sound of a torrent like human voices laughing together overhead leaned far out graceful trees or shrubs like daring girls seeking to look below for coming loverskneeling on tufts of waving mountain vines softly lighted by the stars and rising moon the breeze came from the sea to woo the night and its cool breath was pleasant to the giantlike young etruscan but the indian sage drew his cloak about him and as he seated himself on a stone said ‘yet a few minutes and we shall be before the ancient god know that long ago even during the days of the earliest dwellers in italy there was a civilisation which far transcended that of savages for wherever there is a race with genius there will be work however rude to prove it at that time the spirit of whom i spoke had here a temple then in a later age when other races such as thine o flaxius invaded italy these people forewarned by divinity left the marvellous image brought from some asian clime in which their deity had dwelt and walling up the shrine with utmost care laboured long to destroy all outward traces of man’s work and fled ‘then the god who had before ever been present in the statue also left the cave but once a year does he return to it to revivify that which was once himself unto mankind even as in all countries feudal possessions are held by the tenure of annual presence and the performance of some deed and the performance to which he is pledged is to answer to such words as may be spoken to him which indeed are few and far between since among the spiritual and theosophists there are not many who care for such inveterate old heathenism and hardpressed material firmbaked worldliness as his ‘thou o flaxius having by mortal virtue won the grace of an immortal fata or celestial fairy who is well nigh one of the gods hast had the strange chance of a man who is to be perfected in worldly wisdom and therefore art sent to confer with him who mastered it in the past long it is i ween since he ever saw before his shrine such a neophyte as thou art’ ‘and now let us enter’ saying this he pressed aside the boughs and leaves of a dense thicket or copse finding again a passage till he came to what seemed to be a bare wall of rock here he tapped thrice with his staff whereupon a door opened and they entered a widearched hall illuminated by a very soft and brilliant light whose source was not visible but seemed to be in the air itself a single and silent form that of a youth of beautiful but strange type as of another race led them to the baths where they found after their ablutions in perfumed water fresh linen garments ready for them they were then taken to another apartment where a meal was spread it gave no great promise being simply a cake for each with wine which however in no wise astonished sages who knew the secrets of transcendental cookery and of draughts distilled with rosicrucian skill and then being greatly refreshed the aryan spoke once more ‘thou wilt now behold the god and i bid and beg thee earnestly that thou ere speaking wilt consider long and very seriously his countenance following it to the very depths of its expression and through all the shadows and tones of meaning which it awakens in thy memory or imagination now if thou art as becomes a true student of wisdom keenly perceptive of the soul in the facethat is a genuine physiognomistthen wilt thou with the aid of what i have told thee know enough to learn more’ and with this they went into a great hall at the further end in a wonderfully quaint shrine which seemed like a dense swarm of blinking jewels and living gems swimming in gold was a most marvellous image it was apparently of some strange creamywhite or ivorylike material browned or veined by great antiquity into rich dark tones and blending polished hues as if time had completed on it with unusual care the daintiest part of the handwork of the artist one would think it had been made by keats in the form itself there was manifest a most archaic rudeness there was in it nothing of the divine grace of the greek and yet it had not the ugliness of the old traditional forms of the egyptian for he who made it had gone straight to nature copying what he saw there without convention it was the converse of art flaxius bowed low before the form the aryan prostrated himself flat on the ground uttering a fervent prayer in many strophes burning incense withal and chanting an invocation but the young etruscan gazed boldly at the god steadily and without fear as a norse champion might have gazed at odin or thor had either faced him and as the mystic light shone on the deeply inscrutable countenance of the aryan sage and the splendid selfconfidence and jovial air of flaxius like an asiatic prefiguring of the roman or of the race predestined to conquer the worldand finally on the marvellous mystery of the god the wisest observer might well have thought that even in those days such a trio was without its equal on earth there they were even as they are today the transcendental oriental the vigorous prototype of the coming europe and the obscuring image of the giant pasta goodly picture for the artist who could do it justice and what flaxius first beheld in the face was the coarse and laughing look not even of the lowest faun or satyr but of a boor or clown ‘grinning through a horsecollar’ such as i have seen in a head of the fourteenth century in an old hall in herefordshire a look changing an instant later into the expression of a devil with an unutterable depth of malice and despair as of lunacy in man but whether it was the play of the mystic light or of something more marvellous within he suddenly saw a new soul in it as of a higher and more cultured fienda mephistopheles who denied all things and smiled on all and yet it was the same face and anon there came insensibly the expression of the sage who cold and calm observes all human error and earthly change like one studying insoluble problems ‘now we have come’ thought flaxius ‘to the earliest greek philosophers cynic and stoic and epicureansunshine on ice’ and anon it was the poet seeking his similes and correspondences in nature and man caring not so that he found the beautiful and vivid how contradictory the elements might be ‘ha art thou there hesiodor is it homeror sapphoor seest thou thy singers of the mahabarata and kalidasa’ inquired flaxius of the indian ‘yes’tis all the samethe simile and the antithesisthe contradiction and anomaly which point man’s highest poetry’ but the face was ever the same nor had it changed ‘and last of all i see the seeker into all’ reflected flaxius ‘he who from the lowest sense of incongruity as from the deepest agony of passion and faith from the highest truth evolved by philosophy as from the whirling millionfolded threads of the garment of god draws only the conclusion of strife and absurd change the eternal wheel of the law held by a laughing fiendall is humourand thus endeth the first lesson’ then he spoke to the god ‘i perceive that i can see in thee no more since i have got back to my beginning doubtless there are in thee higher phases which i the mere pupil cannot perceive all of us cannot fathom everything but what i have learned during this past hour transcends all that i knew before and i must live ages upon earth to master it humour is the perception of incongruity and imperfection of contrasts and errors the truest humorist is he who sees it with the most philosophy and truth’ there was silence and then there came a deep yet soft and solemn voice from the god ‘thou hast learned all which i expected from theenow learn to live in life and take it as it comes since gods and men are all subject to the same laws seek continually knowledge is the soil which when well cultivated yields the grain by which thou canst live children go in peace i have spoken’ ‘he spoke well’ said the aryan sage ‘very well but not beyond his past mine is another road the true and faradvanced sage my flaxius can by penance and contemplation rise through the ages far above all changes and contradictions of nature and of matter and pass through the gate of nirvanato eternal and unchangeable peace and happiness whether it be as some suppose into absorption with the highest happiness or to pursue new fields of individual actions beyond all that intellect has ever dreamed i know not but that he can escape thereby the miseries of change i do believe’ ‘but that is only for one in millions’ remarked flaxius ‘eternity is long’ replied the sage ‘i think’ answered the etruscan ‘that as all truth is threefold there may be yet a third way what it is i truly do not know but i will think of it meanwhile i have enough to do for many a year in following out what i this night have learned before i endeavour to excel in the higher heavenly mathematics and celestial algebra and transcendental curves and equations i will first master this earthly arithmetic perhaps a few of your sages might find the gate of nirvana sooner if they would do so you theosophists forget that you are here in this world as ants and that the visions and thoughts of the eaglehowever grand and fine they may beare misplaced in the emmet speculations in billions of æons and millions of millenniums and blue eternities are folly for men whose manifest measure of black and white time is the change of day and night the course of seasons and the path of years you narrate minutely what occurred for thousands of kalpacs to the gods yet cannot trace your own human history accurately for more than a few centuries to me it seems that knowledgelike charityshould begin at home and like unto it friend but even worse do i find your esoteric reincarnation the gradual evolution of all men through revolving cycles which requires for ‘complete unfoldment’ a solar system on the seven principles through each of which the soul makes seven rounds in seven races and so on through seventy times seven sevenings with seven times seventy new senses seasonings and so on ere you can get the human being into good form reminds one very much of the machine depicted by hogarth there are in it steel wheels and springs cogs latchets levers eccentrics valves and god knows what allto draw a cork ‘you reply that eternity is long and by that saying you refute yourself for life seems to be all to him who is in it and you require man to master study understand and in life live up to a system which he can only comprehend or do anything with in a million of years wherein o friend thou art illogical ‘and yet o aryan i thank thy faith for the time was not quite lost which i spent in studying it for even as oysters lead to soup and soup to fish and good pièces de résistance or beef and game so do i prophetically foresee that this thy indian soup of speculation will lead to german metaphysics which will conduce to the fish of a naturphilosophie which will bring man to the english roast beef of darwin and huxley and solid pudding thereunto ‘and i thank thee for introducing me to this god in whom i find incarnate the moral aspect of the mere materialism in which i for the time live move and have my being truly it is not quite enough for one who would fain think that ’tis not all of life to live nor all of death to die but it is all in all sufficient for the disciple of epicurus and lucretius which it is well to be for once in life’s journey wherein we must sometimes stop in queer inns of hedonism ‘now may we in the ages often meet farewell until our paths again are one’ and with this each went his way again into life ‘hæc fabula docet’ wrote the great master as a note ‘this legend teacheth a lesson which may peradventure not be unto all quite so plain as a fly in a milkpan or the sun at noonday oculis subjecta fidelibus or “before our werry eyes” as the elder weller hath it or as intelligible as onethird of the sermon of arlotto was to himselfche n’intese luifor which reason o refined reader i will explain it to thee the ancient godkin whom i did interview represents the practical wisdom of life as based on a narrow materialism which sees in all things only atoms and chance and believes that nature does but carry out things to a certain extent when they fail or roll the stone up a hill whence it comes tumbling back on sisyphus therefore his worshippers found in life only contradictionsand paradoxes without end now it is true that these abound in life and are the soul of humour and of poetry and exist from laughter up to sublimity in everything materialyet is this crude materialism far away different from that evolution which i afterwards learned which goes deeper than atoms and believes in infinite progress from stage to stage in ideals and the everadvancing power of volitional consciousness or human will in the course of progress through the ages paradoxes disappear or else are succeeded by high and nobler and purer forms of the complex and contradictory’ flaxius and rooseveldt ‘when julius cæsar gave the deputies from gaul their rights and treated them as men all rome roared out in rage because in rome all foreigners were held as vile and low and thus it was that cæsar showed himself most perfectly the bravest of mankind and fittest man of all to rule the state’ comment by miss winifrede orr on the following chapter ‘and the pharisees and scribes murmured saying this man receiveth sinners and eateth with them’st luke xv 2 the wise and great flaxius in his steps from century to century did much to endear himself to the men of the present who take a pride in their northern ancestry for when no elegant roman scholar would have given a rusty denarius to know what was going on in the whole world north of italy our sage made himself intimate with odin and thor not to mention the god frey whose name is yet borne by descendants of the old stock had been favoured by freya had read the first edition of the edda scraped in runes on birchbark had suggested emendations in it and so on he was a great friend of olaf tryggvason whose true history and it is a marvellous one yet remains to be written and hereandthereing about it happened that he came into the netherlands where he made acquaintance with king gambrinus the inventor of beer but in fact it was flaxius who having in india learned from vishnu the art of brewing soma which is now generally agreed to have been india pale ale taught him the secret and not to digress i would here note that bass has his name from bassaro a place in lydia where bacchus had a temple which name is supposed to be derived from the hebrew bassar to gather in a vintage because in those days beer was regarded as a sort of wine an idea still preserved by german poets who call it barleywine as for ale flaxius affirms that it is found in the marvellous myth of alesia a city of sicily where there was a fountain which foamed up joyously at the sound of music so that the froth ran over the brim just as lager is believed to foam in the glass when students sing for which the reader may consult pliny lib 3 and solinus as for the lager i have witnessed that miracle myselfand hope to see it again and it is also true as it is lovely that the beautiful clear pilsener beer as well as that of vienna will leap up in joyous bubbles when it hears an orchestra play as ye may see for yourselves according to puttuli if you chance to be present when it occurs and it is for this reason that the cup of the winds which is before me as i write a goblet of the tenth century carved from wood and undoubtedly a lombard beercup has on it the four modes in music each represented by a female figure playing on a musical instrument and all their skirts blowing in a high wind to signify aria or melody which is a pun in wood even as the catholic church is one in stone ergo bibamus and while thus upanddowning in the north flaxius came to holland which had at that time been but recently taken by the dutch now at this particular period or p p as a friend of mine used to denote the great dates in the margin of his history the netherlands were under the dominion of siegfried the dragonkiller as you may learn from wagner’s opera who had for a wife eventually the fair chriemhilde so sweetly described in the book of heroes ‘her heart in beauty burninga ruddy ruby shone the gleaming of her eyelets was like the glowing moon she clad herself in roses and pearls as bright and rare yet none came to the maiden to give her comfort there she was right fair of figure and slender in the waist like to a golden lustre naught in her form misplaced her hands and fingers perfect each unto either trim her nails so white and shining you could see yourself therein her hair was bound in beauty with noble silken twine she let it flow adownward that lovely maiden fine she wore a crown with jewels and all of gold so red of elberich the dwarfling she had in truth great need and in that crown bright shining lay a carbùncle stone which even in the palace like a bright topaz shone upon her head the ringlets in glossy masses lay they gleamed as clear and brightly as doth the sun by day she stood alone unheeded right sorrowful her mood how beautiful her colour it was like milk and blood and through her locks so purely the neck shone white as snow ah elberich the little felt deep the maiden’s woe’ then in time her sorrow was relieved and amid the conflicting jar of legendary songs it appeared that she married siegfried but her great deed was to lay out a glorious and wonderful garden of roses or rooseveldt in german rosengarten of which carlyle writes ‘chriemhild whose altered history makes such a figure in the nibelungen had it would seem a rosegarden some seven english miles in circuit fenced only by a silk thread wherein however she maintained twelve stout fighting men and these so unspeakable was their prowess sufficed to defend the silkthread garden against all mortals a good antiquary von der hagen imagines that this rosegarden in the primæval tradition glances obliquely at the ecliptic with its twelve signs at jupiter’s fight with the titans and we know not what confused skirmishing in the utgard asgard or midgard of the scandinavians’ of the great battle of all the heroes of the north about or in this rosefield i will say nothing suffice it to write that in time the fair chriemhilde had a son by siegfried ‘though history passes it over oh’ and this offspring grew up to be a glorious youth who was known as the lord of the rooseveldt from his patrimony being often called simply roosevelt for brevity’s sake and he was a credit to his highly respectable ancestry first making himself famous in learning and letters then in council holding divers offices and yet again in a war with spain wherein he gained great renown till in the fulness of time he governed holland or had a kingdom therein which he administered with wisdom and grace now there are some folk who are brave in one way and some in another some bravingmad when drunk and others only bold while sober or to show off or to gratify temper but roosevelt was brave all round having not only physical but in the highest degree moral courage for he had that of his opinions which is the noblest of all and flaxius to his great joy observed this the king had soon seen in the sage great wisdom and a genial spirit and had therefore made of him a friend it came to pass one day that as they were riding near the rhine they saw seated by the roadside a poor man of very dark colour yet one who seemed as if he might be far better than his looks ‘whence camest thou’ asked the king ‘with the sun whose livery i wear from the south i am of the dark races and was brought here a captive’ ‘what hast thou seen’ ‘i have seen sorrow and felt oppression heard curses tasted bitterness and smelt the air of dungeons and all because of my colour for god knows my soul is white enough and were my skin the same i should be called learned and perhaps something more yet at this minute i am hungry and few indeed are they who would give me food and none who would eat with me’ ‘by frey and all the gods’ cried roosevelt in anger ‘come thou with me friend and we will see whether no man will keep thy company for i am lord of all this land and i swear that this day thou shalt dine with me in my palace sitting at my table with me and may loki and svanttowit teuston vith and busteric chrodo swackenhammer irminsul hela hellwolf zernebock1 and the whole gang do their worst with me if i stand not by thee’ so they went to the palace and the pilgrim was bathed and clad in seemly garments and when the horn was blown for dinner and the band struck up lo there sat the dark man at the royal table and roosevelt treated him as he did the other guests but the dark man behaved modestly like any other gentleman conversing chiefly with flaxius about foreign countries ‘there will be a row about this’ said flaxius to breitmann a northern warrior who spoke a barbarous dutch and who was something of a bard because he had sung a ‘bardy’ he was poet laureate ‘you pet all you got on it’ was the reply ‘all de small minds who had rader live in a liddle country dan in a pig von will pe hoppin’ mad and efery man who has nodding boot a white colour to make him resbectaple and a crate many pious beople among dem will fluke and coorse and damn der roosevelt for peing too moosh like de lord jesus who did in his vay de fery same ding i shall have to sing a song apout dis’ it is certainly true that what breitmann who as a poet was also something of a prophet predicted came to pass for there was great rage all over the land and people cursed and ‘swore in high dutch’ and abused their lord for being morally brave and good and it was noticed withal that everybody in the land who came of a race which had ever grunted and groaned because it had been ‘persecuted’and there were a great many of theseall cried out the loudest against ‘the nigger’ to show their social superiority but the king knowing that he had done right before god and man cared not one broken straw for them all ‘go thy ways o king’ said flaxius admiringly ‘for the best and noblest kindest and bravest man who ever sat on a throne and had the least fear to do what is right others have been of good descent and brave some again brave and learned others as bold and honest but of them all thou alone art all and with it the only one who dared be a friend to the downtrodden and oppressed now for this god bless thee roosevelt and thou shalt be blessed and even if the future has no more great or glorious deeds for thee rest content thou hast shown more true courage than any monarch before thee ever did saving christ the lord of all the world’ then it came to pass in the year 1901 but here the chronicle abruptly ends history repeats itself now the laureate kept his word and made a song which he sang to a harp which song travelled from scheveningen up the rhine till it arrived about a month later at cologne it was thence transferred to heidelberg by a wandering minnesinger to constance which lies on the bodensee as is affirmed in a very ancient ballad which consists of nothing else but this fact repeated fifty times in different forms in which it bears a great resemblance to much modern intellectual effort as displayed in political speeches sermons and the like and from the bodensee it was colported by divers wandering students and handwerksburschen through german switzerland till one warm day it crossed the alps and got to verona or berne in lombardy where i believe it stopped albeit there is a passage or two in the divina commedia which indicate that dante had possibly come across some rude italian version of it and this was the lied which i have followed closely der noble roosevelt ‘it is writ in many a shtory which came from olden time in legends full of glory in many a minstrel’s rhyme dot he who acted kindly since history began and gently to all beople was der truest gentleman and among de very truest of dis kind in der welt as die rose among de ritters i put der

over this deity that george borrow came to grief when he ridiculed walter scott for making an old saxon witch swear by him for the saxons did adopt zernebock though he was the cerneboh or black god of their slavonic neighbours flaxius and hamlet showing how the prince of denmark when at the university of wittenberg listened to the lecture on roman history by the learned flaxius and was taken by the latter to a ball and introduced to the fairy queen ‘o valiant hamlet and worthy of immortal fame who being shrewdly armed with feint of folly covered a wisdom too high for human wit under a marvellous disguise of want of sense and in that subtlety found means whereby he did protect himself and yet revenge the murder of his father long before’saxo grammaticus lib 3 it happened once amid the blaze the splendour and the symmetry of the centuries as they whirled magnificently onmany ere this of ours yet many more after wise flaxius had his natal daythat the scholar went to the university of wittenberg to see what he could pick up in the way of ideas for with all his experience and erudition he was always learning something new as any man may at any hour in this world school if he be not too proud to note facts as somebody’s wisdom hath it in latin ‘ea est vera nominis existimatio quæ non ex sermonibus sed ex rebus istis deducitur’ or as an englishman more concisely expressed it ‘there’s nothing like facts to learn from’ and being a man of marked yet modest mien who conversed in latin with singular purity and one who when he so pleased could construct his whole discourse out of nothing but quotations from the classicsor from the works of his auditors which was even more agreeable to themhe was soon held in great esteem and having read in public a paper de vera essentia verborum in which he demonstrated from a artemidorus down to z zoilus that words have souls he came to be regarded as clericus vel addiscens almost a professor so it befel one day when a certain teacher named brunkenstrorphius was incapacitatedowing to fourteen bottles of rhenish wine the night beforefrom lecturing that flaxius kindly took his place and read to his class in roman history the subject for that day being nero now as flaxius had had the great advantage of having been long personally acquainted with this emperorto whom he was introduced by senecaand had been present by special invitation at the brilliant reception which was lighted by a whole congregation of early christians rolled in pitch and ignited had talked with locusta and seen the stupendous spectacle of the burning of rome with an imperial orchestra of one and received an estate for exclaiming ‘artes omnes novit cæsar’ and was finally in at the death of that remarkable artist he had almost as good a conception of the true character of the latter as sundry modern novelists and immoralists who have so black or whitewashed him by turns that his memory seems to be like the cathedral of florence or a zebra or a chequer board or a bad photograph or what the liberal and conservative press in turn declared of gomthat is to say an alternation of ebony and ivory of coal and alabaster the raven and blanche dove or a prussian sentrybox or a cup jewelled in niello or saint paul’s or a cardinal’s conscience according to flaxius the emperor was in himself something such a combination well nigh beyond all the analysis of our modern moral chemistry the wondrous product of a monstrous age a terrible thought elaborated with agony from a mighty but corrupt world one who in the true spirit of history was more a symbol than a man mere bronze medal from the iron die of his time the lecturer could well nigh believe that no nero per se had ever existed at all but had been a mere simulacrum or phantom set up in a high place wherewith the mighty powers who rule the world had mocked or lessoned man a pharos or beacontower with an effulgent burninghead standing deeply footed in the freezingcold damp roaring seaa giant giving light in agony and warning ships not to approach and like old pharos fearful in his pride there was a kind of daïs or higher range of seats and desks at which sat only the young noblemen who were studying at the university and among these was one who to flaxiuswho was a marvellous reader of men not only by metoposcopia or physiognomy but by all which was indicative of the soulseemed to be as far beyond all his fellows as an eagle would be amid the dullest pettiest featherlings of a barnyard yet though very quietly dignified he was devoid of that arrogance of rank which displayed itself so conspicuously in every detail of dress every gesture and in the very intonation of every word of the aristocracy of that time for he was truly too much above them to affect even their superioritya thing in which the german noble of the present day hath still almost everything to learn especially in prussia for even yet among these good folk well nigh all the joy of life and mental life itself consists in the happy reflection that a majority of mankind are by law at least their inferiors which stupendous idea it being generally their only possible one they contemplate even as a hindu saint contemplates god to the exclusion of all other conception this reflection has been concisely made into a law of ethical science by one of their number an austrian named von mannteufel in the words ‘humanity properly speaking begins with the rank of count’ this young nobleman was indeed so elevated in rank that he could well afford to dispense with vanity since he was heirapparent to the throne of denmark his name was hamlet and there was that in his appearance which would indicateto even a less clairvoyant eye than that of flaxiusan original character of the strongest type devoid of the eccentricity which attracts comment learned in philosophy without pedantry endowed with a personal grace of manner suggesting natural courtesy and a marvellous observation by a quiet eyeall of which might be seen in him by all but flaxius noted in him something far deeper a soul which if not yet risen was rapidly rising above the storm and whirl of all things in life and time be they great or small so as to behold in them all the mere passing show of a drama yet feeling all the time that in that drama there would be incidents which would wreck this mere mortal life and wrench his soul with agony he who has this tremendous dual action to undergo in lifethat of being a true philosopher yet a great suffererwill assuredly have a strange foreboding of it and to such a mind the idea of nero as presented by flaxius in its similar doubleness was a marvellous revelation he had long suffered from that problem which a great poet has expressed by saying that ‘not in that strife wherefrom i take strange lore and read it deep can i find reason why i should be thus nonowhere can unriddle though i search and pore on nature’s universal scroll even to swooning why divinities the first born of all shaped and palpable gods should cower beneath what in comparison is untremendous might’ all of which flaxius the immortal who could read the soul in the glance and who saw that he had before him one into whose essence immortality had cast its brightest rays deeply divined so it came that he lectured to hamlet alone rising far beyond the rest of the audience and mindful of his man who he felt was thirsting to think he made good long pauses which his auditors deemed were to give himself rests to make new bounds the lecture was at an end and hamlet by a sign intimated to his friends that he would fain be left alone when all were departed he with courtesy beyond the time arose and approached the professor and said ‘learned master thou hast touched with such unerring hand the harpstrings of my heart and drawn from it such marvellous chords that i would gladly have them combined in more coherent melody even as a bee in a bewildered flight driven by the wind at chance may light upon’ ‘a flower’ said flaxius ‘which gives him rest’ ‘and in which too he finds a honeystore such as he never found in flight before’ subjoined the prince gently ‘yet around which some curling petals close somewhat too tightly for his eager search’ added flaxius almost with a smile ‘truly to thee who art born to be a prince among more than mortals i will gladly lend what aid i can to clear away the tangling hindering leaves’ ‘learned master’ replied the prince ‘i would first deeply reflect on what i have heard since i as yet toil slowly after you and if it be your pleasure i pray you seek me this evening in my library’ ‘i will be there’ said flaxius ‘with joy’ flaxius the immortal and the prince who was unconsciously an aspirant for immortality sat at a table under antique grotesquely carved arches before them a flask of rhenish and the works of hesiod and homer in the face of the master there was the calm dignity of centuries in that of hamlet the quiet of a summer sea beneath which tides are working which may break bounds in time of storm they had long held deep discourse and during the time flaxius had penetrated more deeply with every utterance into the soul of the young man at last after a pause the master said ‘he who has risen so far as to find a reality in the tremendous action of the infinite in nature and who has dwelt so long and earnestly on the change of dynasties of gods from saturn to jove of old worlds into new on man in his stormiest moods and the rabbit sporting in the thicket birds and clouds and life still circling on till all such thoughts are most habitualhas gone too far to retreat he has advanced beyond his fellows if he be weak and break down under the stupendous load he will go mad and readily will men esteem him so as they do all whom they cannot understand if he succeed they may deem him a poet or a god but the imbroglio is sadly worse when the man is not a hermit or one alone in life who can battle freely with his destiny if he be one who is enmeshed in some dire tragedy with others which he being human must humanly endure and suffer and yet is always having his wonted glimpses of the infinite as prisoners catch glimpses of the sun then he has before him such a battle and a strife as deserve to bend the decree of fate for very pity those who achieve victory over it all live for ever now know there are two lives beyond the grave one the vital life which ever was and can never pass away the other the life of our great deeds imperishable in the mind of man’ ‘ay’ replied the prince ‘and i feel in my deepest soul great master not only that thou speakest truth but thou ne’er wouldst tell me this didst thou not divine by some mystic power all unknown to me that i am destined to such warring woe worst of all is it for me that i have added into all of this the weakness which must be truly overcome a wax in the bronze which must be melted out a love of sleep and ease and pleasant dreams’ ‘go on thou hast more to say’ replied flaxius ‘well this remains’ rejoined the prince after a long pause a draught of wine and casting his glance briefly at the scrolls before him ‘in all these lives of mortals in the past who rose by power to immortality i find some golden glimpse vouchsafed to them of the supernatural some comforting assurance of beings now invisible to me of gods guardian angels“followers” as my northern ancestors called them or the beautiful fylgia who flit over the ocean after the heroes whom they protect truly if i could only so much as see and talk once with moonlight fairies and merry elves or a sprightly goblin i being only human should have some strengthening assurance that life is not all a struggle with mere mortals and matter even in so little as what i ask i should realise that i shall live do i speak wisely’ ‘yes’ replied flaxius ‘there are men dying with hunger whom a crumb may save this much may be granted to thee ’tis little enough all over doth this outer life an inner life enfold one of exquisite beauty and grace as the rough seaweed and grim ugly moss and ragged madrepores and hard crust envelop the exquisitely curved snowandrosebloom blushing shell the only thing on earth which is like in hues to a lovely maiden around and about us there circles ever in viewless beauty and undreamed perfume moving to music all unheard by man a thronging host of attendant beings following sweet missions and holy biddings talking in mystic tongues of which echoes may be caught in the breeze in the forest and in tinkling springs or falling fountains truly i forget myself when i abstract my mind an instant towards them from this our earthly sphere yes ’tis but little for thee to ask who hast before thee such a destiny to live immortal in a poet’s verse yes i will give it and with all my heart and thou shalt see the light invisible and hear the music never meant for ears to such degree as a beginner may i see thee smilewell be it when thou wilt but as thy wont is thou requirest time to think on what i’ve said go take an hour there lies not far beyond the city gate in a wild place among the lonely rocks an old and crumbling castle which all men shun as a haunted place and in its hall fairies and goblins hold their revelry from midnight till the morning red is seen thither together we will wend our way’ ‘it might seem marvellous to me’ said flaxius as he with hamlet walked forth in the summer night under the stars ‘that thou o prince who livest in the contemplation of greater marvels who seest the miracle of the growth of flowers and the wonders of the circling universe which amaze even the spirits of earth and air shouldst crave a mere glimpse of that which is after all only something new and unaccustomed did i not know how deeply the desire of what is new to him is implanted in man yes it is so deep that he who masters the problem treads on the verge of the infinite i myself’ but here he paused and said ‘yonder rises the tower built as tradition tells by a sorcerer who chanting a spell with every word broke from the rock a stone or conjured dust and air to solid blocks and moved them into place and ’tis no more than man himself will do in days to come and none will deem the deed a miracle hence it is written in ancient chronicles in veterum libris observatum est hoc fieri that the building has ever been haunted nymphæis et fatis and by those strange spirits of the elements whose homes being in the crimson gold of sundyed skies or deep in earth where marvellous gems and metals abound or in forests like the silvani and oreades or in streams like the naïades have by natural affinity a passionate love for poetry and all that is rare and beautiful wild or strange be it in what form it may for as nature is not only lovely and comely in her very self becoming more so the deeper we penetrate her veriest being as natura naturans so is she also in her freer actions often gaily contradictory merrily and quaintly discordant jingling bells to her sweetest music and singing sweet ritournelles of violets over grey and ancient graves for every one of which freaks be they as mad as they may there is some echo of a goblin flibbertigibbet fairy implet bogle browny pixie urchin puck robin goodfellow ouphe or oaf nixey or pixey duergar or troll sprite or pigwiggin sylph or seagirl salamander or firemaid heintzelmann or waldmeister kobold or bergmannlein as here called siren satyr or faunus lemur or lamia yea and thereunto as many more as this outer crust of creation hath manifestations which in themselves are ideas and immortal types with a life such as science hath not as yet apprehended though it will also be clearly known in ages to come for know o prince’ continued flaxius with an air which had in it something of the poet and the god ‘that in due time will dawn upon the world a science of which some of the learned now have not the faintest scent or touch which after denying and destroying the gods goblins and devils in toto corpore as now believed in will end by showing them in matter and in truth and that in a thousand times more marvellous form than any fairytale maker ever fashioned or felt for little as he knows it man instead of leaving the marvellous behind him in remote ages began in truth utterly without it and is now advancing towards and into it with giant footsteps ah here we are at the gate of the elfincastle “which men did raise in the ancient giant and goblin days when they sat with ghosts on the stormy shore and spake in a tongue they speak no more” ‘now for a season be a child again’ as they stood at the gate of the silent pile they heard far far away over many a hill and dale the crowing of a cock and the faint chimes of midnight from the town and then the cry of a sentinel owl from the greentapestried elfintower to which flaxius briefly replied in a strange utterance of some fairy kind when the gate opened and they found themselves in a scene which would not have appeared quite unfamiliar to any child who has beheld a gorgeous and exceptionally tasteful féerique in paris or an unusually marvellous christmas pantomime in london combining all the splendours of aladdin’s palace with all the goblinries of mother goose save that this was a thousand times more splendid more varied more grotesque and more amazing and having entered prince hamlet stood by the door rapt in utter admiration at the marvellous art which in everchanging neverresting beauty and quaintness was displayed before him ‘the witches have their sabbat in the blocksberg’ said flaxius ‘the fairies and all their kin hold their own grand merrymakings but much oftener being merrier folk here and elsewhere witches and devils select scenery suited to their taste fairies conjure up their bright magnificence and airy shows most gladly in germany they revel in ancient halls of castles such as this in imitation of the mortals who preceded them as is shown by the marvellous legend of the old count von hoya’ ‘and that’ said hamlet ‘was only this that the fairies came to the old count and begged him to lend them his great hall for a ball for a single night with the condition that he the master might be present but that no other mortal eye should behold the revel so at the midnight hour in they came tripping fairymaids elfinmen little and beautiful golden gemglittering twofold or triplefold tenfold and twentyfold till the great hall splendidly lighted looked like the crown thickly bejewelled of a great monarch so they danced as you see and the jolly old graf danced with them small was the lady who was his partner three inches high often he lost her in the gay multitude seeking her finding her often he picked her up twixt thumb and finger by her small wings even as children in summer catch butterflies when all at once there was a dead pause the music ceased the dancing stopped while from above was heard an awful scolding human voice it was that of the old countess von hoya who having heard the music she sleeping above lifted a trapdoor and looked down at the spectacle truly she was in a great rage to see such a festive scene to which she was not invited it all died out like an extinguished taper tradition says that the queen of the fairies gave the count in reward for his kindness a miraculous sword ring and horn which his family still preserve but to punish the countess laid a ban upon her descendants that there should never be at one time more than one heir of the name and it has ever been thus as predicted’ ‘so in this life even spirits mimic man a man confirms all things unto himself’ replied hamlet ‘this is a brilliant scene surpassing dreams’ he continued as the elfin guests came pouring in ‘but i note that they are not all butterflyminikins’ which was quite true for they were of all sizes from that of smaller humanity or lesser youth down to the tiniest sprites who hide in honeysuckles and wear roseleaves for cloaks among them all hamlet and flaxius towered like giants nor did they seem out of place since in the mien and eyes of both there was the expression of something not of earth or common life which is never absent from such men but which here in the mysterious magic light which filled the hall coming from no visible source seemed to proclaim itself with tenfold power at the further end of the apartment was a throne of unknown splendour and material in which were intertwined thousands of strange characters red and black like ruby and sable onyx it seemed as if it might be a fairy antique ancient of the ages and on it sat under exquisite rainbow drapery a female form of such ineffable loveliness that hamlet murmured to flaxius that he had found in it a new ideal for beautyit so surpassed yet was so different from all he had ever dreamed of woman’s charms thereupon the queen for such she waswho heard and perceived all thingslooking at them smiled and beckoned an approach when all the small folk parted right and left leaving a lane by which they went their way unto the throne and bowing low before her flaxius holding hamlet by the hand said in tones of marvellous melody learned of yore in the magic schools of etruria ‘to thee allbeautiful type of all loveliness queen of the elfin world life of all fairy land i with all reverence bring a young mortal hamlet of danamark one little witting what immortality he may inherit shouldst thou bestow on him thy benediction’ to this the fairy queen gazing on hamlet as with intense interest in which sympathy and deep pity were most perceptible replied in tones which might have checked the torrent in its course or called the eagle wooing him to hear ‘well do i know thee hamlet of danamark seldom was mortal born to such sorrows never did mortal grapple more bravely with a grim destiny than thou art fated to find in the future’ hamlet in the same staffrhyme but in danish skaldtone which was his humble best replied ‘as to the swimmer a seawolf before him as to the traveller grimmest bear meeting or as the wren with the owl over her is the foreboding of a great norna unto the fated but when the norna is queen of all beauty mingling iron destiny with golden compassion giving the bitter in honey wellcoated gently and tenderly little the fated one recks what may happen mishap and misfortune are meted to many few among mortals ever escape them if the allloveliest gives him her pity he’s to be envied’ now as flaxius was the politest man at heart on the face of the earth while the fairy queen was incarnate politeness itself this lyric which had such a charming accompaniment of courtesy as went beyond music made the most favourable impression and the sage having as court etiquette then required uttered his first words in metre now expressed himself plainly in prose saying ‘beautiful spirit of the strangely beautiful who alone givest to poetry the elfincharm of romance well do i ween that this young prince of denmark is so entirely thy subject and one so noble in truthfulness and so true in his devotion to thy charm that he has not uttered a word of flattery in saying that the direst misfortune of life seems to him to be but a little thing since he has gazed on thy face and felt thy sympathy and truly unto any on whom the queen of faerie and romance has once really smiled this world and all its woes need seem but a little thing since it is perfect assurance of an immortal life beyond but i pray thee make this clearer to him that he may leave with a lighter heart and be the better able to endure his fate’ the queen as if deeply reflecting and as deeply moved replied in gravely measured softly modulated voice ‘nepenthe soothes the vulgar mind alone to the higher soul unfading amaranth brings in time forgetfulness of pain endured and bestows keenest enjoyment of the glory to come in the far future romance and poetry in purity and power can bend the decree of fate and that boon i bestow on thee hamlet prince of denmark listen for i predict that thy life shall be a poemand in days to come long after thy earthly sufferings shall be to thee as naught i will create my greatest work in the greatest poet of romance whom the world will ever know and he shall sing thy life in his greatest song and wherever on earth true poetry is loved and known thou shalt be known and loved with it this can be done and this i swear to do thine be the amaranthi can no more in proof whereof i place upon thy arm this golden ring of amaranthine form’ and as she spoke all seemed to fade before his sight only to the last he felt deeply gazing into his soul with infinite love and sympathy the violet eyes of the queen of fairyland and of romance when he awoke it was early morning he lay on soft moss amid the crumbling ruins of the old castlein sunlight hearing birdsong all about him by his side sat the sage ‘he would have thought it all a dream save that upon his arm was bound the gift of the fairy queen titania’s wondrous charm’ ‘tempus est abeundi’ quoth flaxius ‘’tis time for us to go but litera scripta manet what is written by fate will come to pass o hamlet my son and dear and gracious prince breakfast awaits us and i must think over what i am to say in my lecture on the emperor titus’ how flaxius made the fortune of eadward the grandson of aeolfric ‘it is wise for youth to bow to age’s wisdom’norse proverb ‘for truth is one and right is ever one’spenser’s faerie queene it was in the very old time of merry england in the days when there was so much merriment among those who were above the line of safety and so much misery for those who were below it as would have appalled a modern sociologist when a man who was out of prison and not positively starving to death contrived to be happy when according to the testimony of all writers from caedmon down very nearly to chaucer there was such suffering from all kinds of oppression among the poor as to make the heart sick to think of it out of which very time there has come to us such gay and festive song and chording of harps twanging of citterns ringing of goblets gay hurrahing archery dancing round maypoles and valentining as to make one thrill with joy to think of it for the only rule of life then was ‘eat drink and be merry while ye can for tomorrow we’ll perish be sure my man make the most of what fate will lend you then go wherever the priest may send you’ and it was in the north at a time when anglosaxon and danishicelandic were beginning to be english and there was still much sound old heathenism in men’s hearts and witches rode over the midnight sky while fairies danced in moonlit rings belowthen it was i say that the immortal flaxius paused one fair day on his pedestrian path in northumberland ‘a tall spreading forest there he found with a woodman at work mid oaktrees near the strokes of his axe broke the silence round till the traveller called aloud “come here”’ and he that was called came and flaxius looked at him steadily ere he spoke but with evident approbation and interest he was a young and lithe but strong and vigorous man handsome almost to beauty in face with a straight nose and a keen dark eye in which there was indeed naught repulsive but something strange such as one sees in the glances of uncanny folk who know things of which they do not speak to their neighbours his dress was but little superior to that of the ordinary peasant but there was something in the manner in which it was worn as well as in the bold mien and almost graceful bearing of the youth which indicated rank or ‘birth’ ‘god be with ye’ said flaxius to the woodman ‘i would fain rest here a while and chop a few words with thee so thou be not too busy with thy chopping of wood’ ‘nay’ replied the youth with a quaint pursing of the mouth ‘many strokes fell great oaks and many words bring merry jokes while as for the resting never yet saw i the time when i would not pause to listen to those who are wiser than i am “he who listeneth to eld himself shall be in honour held” as my grandfather was wont to teach me with many a brave tale to prove it’ ‘thy grandfather’ replied flaxius who had meanwhile studied his face more attentively ‘was aeolfric adelwit whom men called the learned and the traveller’ ‘by freiai mean the holy virgin’exclaimed the youth astonished and delighted ‘thou art either a wizard or one who knew him and it may be’ he added lowering his voice and looking round suspiciously ‘perhaps a bit of both for my grandfather who is now i trust in valhall among the heroes and sagesi mean in heaven among the saintswas called a sorcerer by the fools hereabouts’ flaxius smiled each looked at the other with one eye closed the sage shutting the right and the youth the left which is the sign by which the initiated of all grades recognise one another and the one generally used by mahatmas and others in the karma businessas it was by the augurs of yorewhen there were true believers present or under discussion ‘i was even about to take my noonday rest’ said the woodman ‘and if it please you to partake my poor mealthin cider and bread and baconi would it were for your sake wine and a capon’ ‘knowest thou o eadward grandson of aeolfric’ said flaxius solemnly ‘that whoever made a wish in that moment pastat that special position of the planetsbut unwittinglyobtained it behold’ and saying this he opened the basket which the youth had taken from under a thicket and opening it drew forth a large cold roasted capon a manchet of bread and a mighty flask with fruit ‘by the divine banquet of the boar sahrimniri mean the holy supper’cried the youth ‘thou hast come in a lucky hour to get a snack o blessed traveller’ ‘therefore’ exclaimed flaxius producing a great silver goblet from his pack which he filled from the flask ‘therefore o my son drink’ and just then the sunlight catching the stream awoke in it a widespreading ruddy gleam and his whole face yea his very form seemed to be bathed and steeped in ruby ruddy light as a piece of red glass in a cathedral window and so he looked more like a glorious bacchus or merry jupiter transfigured and idealised into a gay glory in a sunset sky wherein the early stars were piping merrily a roundelay for vespers and the clouds like fauns did cluster round to hear ‘i have seen my grandfather by saint eadward’ said the youth for once getting in a christian swear successfully ‘draw good ale from a hole bored in a beechtree which was thought to be a wondrous sorceryi meant miracleby the folk hereabout but he never managed such a tap as this’ he exclaimed as he took a pull which might have half emptied the gialahorn and would have excited the envy of the hornbruderschaft or harddrinking brotherhood founded by the great bishop johann von manderscheit in the castle of hohbarr ‘and by odin who was fed on wine alone’ here he balanced the religious equation ‘and like his holy cup it refills itself’ ‘i bestow it on thee eadward grandson of aeolfric for thy grandsire’s sake’ said flaxius ‘and it shall remain full i swear so long as thou remainest an honest man a true kind heart friendly to those in need and a good valiant joyous drinker and bon compagnon waes hael’ he added taking a draught which was indeed pari passu with that of eadward’s ‘like and like do gladly greet same with joy the same doth meet one good turn deserves another therefore drink with me o brother even as in days of yore commodus rome’s emperor drank his boon companions dumb exsuperantissimum’ ‘trinc hael’ replied eadward with a look of deep steadfast honest gratitude ‘and as i cannot speak my thanks o my greatest benefactor therefore do i drink them’ nor was the young norsesaxon as he said this far unlike a jolly troll or faun himself for the glowing golden red of sun and winelight shone over him and glinted in his hair which was like waves of topaz hanging over his eyes and rolling down his shoulders like a tufted oriole or aureole ‘when autumn browneth wood on hill and the nights are growing chill then upon ye wagon strong ye see caskés borne along black and foul without as sin full of wine and ale within red fire wine and golden ale where from many drinken hale with merry song and minstrelsie as i do drink allheart to thee’ and he who had peeped into that shady dell on that summer day and seen the pair amid green leaves gay with the wondrous wizard aura or rich flood of winelight all round them as they caroused and sang would have verily believed he saw two joyous pagan sylvan gods who hidden well away behind the age had met to live the gay old times again ‘and now tell me eadward’ said flaxius ‘to a hair how it goes with thee in life’ ‘my grandfather as thou knowest’ replied the youth ‘was learned and had travelled in many lands he went to norway whence he never returned it was said that when king olaf tryggvason assembled all the wise men in the old heathen religion in a house to which he set fire and in which they were burned alive my grandsire also perished and it was a cursed deed whoever did it something of latin and other lore i learned from my grandfather who bade me keep it ever a secret saying that “he is a fool who shows his lore to any save to his superiors therein” but what land my grandsire left my father lost so that all i have now is a field and a wood and mine own arms yet with some wit and selling and trading cattle i keep my home truly in no great style’ flaxius mused and said ‘i knew thy grandfather and though he was not far advanced as a magian yet he had fairy blood from distant strain and he was above all things a good and honest man and it is among us a duty to aid the descendants of all such men when they are deserving now i will help thee to help thyself but note well eadward never in thy life didst thou so need every virtue as thou wilt need them now to succeed for this is the usual secret of rising to fortune some friend puts our feet on the first step of the ladder or guides us to it but we must climb the rest ourselves’ ‘something like this’ said eadward ‘did i once hear from my grandfather ‘“look well round thee with thine eyes where’er thou art if thou wouldst rise it is not by a single flight but step by step we gain the height so up the tree the emmet goes even as rolf the giver rose”’ ‘well sung’ quoth flaxius ‘and pass the cup now take this dried leaf’ he gave to the youth a doubled strip of parchment like a thin book in which was indeed a leaf ‘tonight or tomorrow go bathed and fasting to bed then eat this leaf and note what thou shalt dream do exactly to a hair what thou mayst be told to donothing more nor less after that all will depend on thy own good sense courage and kindness and when one year shall have passed by thou wilt see me again to render count of all that thou hast done’ so they parted with kind words the youth to try his fortune and flaxius like odin ever onwards to the north a year had passed and the immortal sage sat in a wild and adventurouslooking place deep buried amid lonely woods and cliffs by a headlong torrent before the odinstone a strangely shaped rock seeming like a druidic megalith through which there was a hole of a foot in diameter it was a striking object and flaxius well knew it had a tale for he had been there and then he heard the trampling of a horse in the woods he looked up and saw a magnificent steed on which sat a knight in splendid attire the rider dismounted it was eadward and the two embraced ‘yea i have the flask and it has never run dry’ said the youth producing it ‘that tells a good tale’ replied flaxius so they filled and drank ‘and now let me hear the details’ ‘make spede is a good rede’ replied the knight ‘this is the story which i set before ye ‘as you bade i ate the leaf and went to bed and in a dream there came to me a white lady or a norna such beauty did i never see before and she said “eadward grandson of aeolfric go tomorrow to the odinstone even where we now are and watch for one hour then do as thou wilt” word no more spake she but vanished and i awoke ‘so i went with my crossbow and knife to the stone and here i watched for one hour yet i saw nothing then as i was about to go i saw a strange thing for there came creeping through the hole in the stone a fox and such a fox i never saw before for it was of a beautiful tawny soft golden colour and on it was a large black cross and though i was in awe somethingit seemed like a voicebade me slay it i did so and skinned it and wrapped the skin and put it in my bag and went my way ‘now there isit may be half a day’s walk from herea rock on which ulf the dane in olden time after a great battle had carved the image of a wolf with runic knots and letters very curious to behold and there i paused a while to rest and anon there came to me a man an outlander as i weened but he pleased me and we held discourse he was not rich of apparel but he had this horse here and a better i never saw for truly by sleipniri mean by the white steed of death seen by saint johnthere is not its like in all the land ‘so we talked and i gave him of my wine and we spake of elves and wizards and dreams and then he said “i will tell thee a strange tale for indeed it was a dream which brought me hither but i fear to little purpose and no good as the troll said of the long talk which ended by his being turned to stone ‘“and this” he said “is sooth and truth” and he sang ‘“unto king ulfbrand thus spake the wise man he the deep learned servant of frey ‘danger is over thee wild screaming war eagle on the mossgrown tree by the white cataract calleth on death to thee and the claw of the bear has scratched runes on the beechtree and thy realm will be lost unless thou winnest the skin of a fox of colour pale golden with a black cross’ ‘“now the king was sore afraid and offered his daughter to any of his nobles who could win him the prize and i with small hope asked a witch one whom i had greatly befriendedyea saved her life and given her shelter and she studied her spells seven days and nights with great pain and then bid me obey my first dream and i dreamed that i should trust in and abide by a wolf for three days and coming here by chance i heard this rock called the wolf and so at haphazard here i have remained but nothing has come of it and i fear me that nothing will” ‘then it came into my mind’ said eadward ‘hearing this that i myself should go to king ulfbrand and win a great reward and yet again that this would be foul play to the man before me and that thou flaxius didst bid me to be generous and true so i prayed in my soul to all the gods’ ‘and a sweetlymixed mythology thou hast my dear boy’ reflected flaxius ‘and then said to the man taking the skin from my bag “is not this what thou seekest take it in god’s name for i believe it should be thine” ‘then he turned white and red for joy and amazement and said ‘“i will not haggle and cheapen with thee like a pedler for ill fate befalls the man who is mean in buying such things all that i have in this world save my land is this horse and ten gold pieces and i give them to thee and i would i had more” so i took his horse but i gave him two gold pieces for his journey as faregold and so he went his way ‘but i rode on unthinking and wondering whether i had done wisely yet hoping hard as did gautrek when he fought the bear when following a road i came upon a horse which had been hard ridden with bloody sides it seemed to be dying and yet anon a furlong further in the woods i found a noble knight lying by a brook who seemed in as evil case as the horse for he was sorebruised and could hardly move and barely speak ‘then i asked him what it meant and he replied in pain ‘“for two days i have fled before a band of foemen who will be here anon and they seek my life” ‘then i gave him to drink from thy flask o master and verily it was a marvellous thing to behold how it revived him for he rose up and said ‘“had i thy horse i might even yet escape there are men who would fight thee for it but thou hast i think saved me with thy wine and i will do naught in dishonour but if thou lovest god and hast man’s faith in truth i pray thee lend me thy steed and it will be no loss to thee” ‘as he spoke i heard far away a sound as of a mountain brook and i knew it was men riding at full speed and as it became like a clatter of hail and wind i cried ‘“take another drink of wine and mount my horse in the names of odin and christ and ride for thy life” ‘and he did but paused to draw a ring from his finger and say ‘“three days’ ride to the west lies the castle of my father the earl of ellaborne if thou canst carry to him what is in the mail on my horse show him this ring and repeat the word truth three times” ‘and with that he was off like an arrow and he had good cause to ride for ere i could have counted a hundred there came a band of riders fierce as wolves who asked me if i had seen a knight pass that way now they had not seen the foundered horse for they came by another path and not being minded that they should slay the knight i delayed them while i could giving them to drink and then showed them the wrong road for between a lie and a die or a man’s life there’s short choice ‘now when i returned to the horse i being somewhat learned in such matters found him in better case than i deemed and having poured wine down his throat and cared for him and given him rest he was soon in good case to ride and there was in the mails much gold and certain parchments which i had lore enough to discern were great state matters for the king and i saw that i had come into affairs of life and death for all the land ‘and minding the proverb “he must be a thin blade who would slip between great stones” i went by the loneliest ways in dark valleys and woodlands wild till i got to ellaborne castle and there was mourning and all were in dire distress weeping and heartsunken because the old lord had heard his son was slain but when i arrived with the horse which was known to all there was mighty todo and great questioning but i spoke word to none till i was brought before the great earl and it was pitiful to see how broken and sorrowful he seemed ‘“and thou hast come to prove to me that my son was truly slain hast thou not” he inquired “since thou hast brought his horse” ‘“nay” i replied “by odin and frey who brings fortune i know he escaped alive and well for when i last saw him he was galloping away on a safe road mounted on the best steed in northumbria with his pursuers on the wrong track ‘“man” cried the earl “if what thou sayest be sooth and if thou didst aid him to escape and saved his life then by god’s glory thou shalt have castle and landsif thou canst prove it” ‘“for the proof o my lord” i answered “here are the papers and gold” ‘“ah the papers” cried the earl “by the splendour of the virgin though i love my son better than my own life i had liefer he had died than that those papers had been found by the enemy what is thy nameeadwardknow that this day thou hast saved england” “‘the proof my lord” i said as i gave him the ring “is thisand the words truth truth truth and know of a truth for i will swear it in any shrine that i did not save thy son’s life for gold or fee or aught promised or hoped for save the price of my horse nor would i have stuck at that to keep a goodly knight from being murdered” ‘“true as gold art thou” said the old lord “and of good blood for now i know thou art the grandson of aeolfric who was noble but poor as he was learned” ‘then he heard the whole tale from me and said ‘“thou hast this day built up the fortune of thy house and if the king do not raise thee to honour i will” ‘but the king treated me nobly and the end thereof was that i am a belted knight and lord of castles and broad lands for i went into the war and fate favoured me and now i have wealth and fame and i have wedded a niece of the earl of ellaborne whom i love better for herself than for her possessions all of which master i owe to thee and thanks are all i can give to such a mighty master of fate as thou art but if i could give thee my life i would’ ‘i believe thee my son’ replied flaxius ‘but what became of the young earl’ ‘he saved himself and we are now as brothers yea’ he continued with a smile ‘to him alone have i confided the holy secret of the miraculous bottle’ ‘godamercy’ exclaimed flaxius ‘’tis well there’s not a headache in a hogshead of it else i trow ye had toped yourselves into hela or up to valhall to fancy two young norsesaxons with an unlimited well of wine is terrible ‘but let us drink’ ‘hæc fabula docetthis fable teaches’ annotated the master ‘a marked moral lesson which is greatly needed at this present day and which no man has as yet taught it befell about thirty years ago when people began to doubt the ancient doctrine of so much pudding here on earth for so much piety always punctually paid that divers young scapegraces of the press who wished to appear as verdant greens always do interestingly wicked and sceptical began to write comicas fabulas or merry tales wherein the little good boys all came to grief as for instance how master benjamin benevolence gave his penny to an old nigger and earned a whipping from his mother for so doing’ these writers left out of sight the great fact that because there may not be a moral providence which keeps a book account to a farthing with all mortals it still by no means follows that there is no decency honour or honesty or moral retribution left among mankind as their immensely funny tales would lead the heedless to believe for bad as this world may be there are still gentlemen extant in dealing with whom the current moral standards of mark lane houndsditch wall street the stock exchange and similar dens of sharps and sharks may well be laid aside there are still men who reciprocate generosity with generosity and the ‘devilish shrewd’ fellow is to them a natural object of aversion because they know that he who cannot be done will infallibly do his best friend in the long run and the man who is cheatproof is a miraculous exception if he be not a cheat himself in short that it is more creditable to be taken in than to take others in the which statement when made by me to a young lady from toronto was received with the astonished remark ‘well that is a new idea’ now it befell the young hero of this tale or eadward to have to deal with only honest or honourable men and he did exactly what was right under every circumstance the result being that he was promptly rewarded showing that virtue is not always punished as current literature inculcates and if there were one hundredth part of the pains taken to teach youth the vast superiority of honour to wealth which there is to stimulate them to acquire the latter then we should indeed find far more gentlemen in the world and in due proportion due reward for decency and there is many a millionaire who would give half his money to be a gentleman a man of true honesty and nobility of soul but there was never yet one who was truly of the latter who would exchange aught with the former for whatever the vast multitude of howling cads may think the gentleman is the superior in that in which he ought to excel and this superiority or moral mastery is better worth having than carriages operabox and a fashionable familywho wish you were dead for your money and this lessonthat there may be circumstances in life when the sharp game is not the best and when the very shrewdest would come to grief unless guided by natural generosity and nobilitydeserves to be deeply studied by the world in general and sharp americans in particular to judge by my personal experiences of both and i would that the novelist and literary man and all who write for the public would teach this thing in spirit and in truth if they can with real sympathy and not go on for ever as mostay the very utmost of the most dopreaching it in a formal listless ‘be virtuous and you will be happy’ way while they depict the advantages of wealth and the merest mammon varnished with fashion and style with all the gush and fire and power of art which they possess but a book written with earnestness setting forth genially that honneur passe richesse is as yet among the curiosities yea the rariora of literature there is indeed no lack of authors who say this thing and who think perhaps they mean it but they do not send it home to the heart nor prove it nor illustrate it so as to awaken in the mind of the reader a deep sympathy for honour as compared to wealth no not one as they should and perhaps could do for it does not occur to you o dearly beloved that all these infinite scenes of flirtation in belgravia or cameliadom showing how she would and then wouldn’t and then was incomprise and anon capricious or toploftyminded or interesting and mysteriousmiserable and how he pauvre malheureux with his gnawed moustachios and dreadful devotion are all nothing but the direct results of too much money and its consequent idleness or ennui and the other ways of plotmaking and interesting the reader are with few exceptions indeed all cakes from the same dough therefore am i reminded of the french author’s recipe for a novel ‘commencez toujours avec un million’ and as it seems to me that literature for the multitude can hardly sink lower than it has done into this swamp of wealth of late years i have hope that it will ere long begin to rise flaxius and asmodeus out of mere mischief and mockery grew evil even as loki from playing boyish tricks became the devil to do evil is one thing to study and understand it is another but in all ages men have confused the two ’twas on a syrian summer afternoon therefore a warm one that flaxius sat in the silent solitude of a ruined city of most ancient days in midian a place wherein the satyr has not even yet met the english tourist nor the egipani or demons of the lonely wildnesses been called to stand and deliver statistics to the german savant he sat on a wedgeinscripted stone about a young bird’s flight from what had been of yore a purplelined palace of sweet sin but so tremendous in its majesty even in decay and decency that the sternest puritan who ever iconoclasted a cathedral would have thought twice ere ravishing this house of baal ‘beauty’ said flaxius ‘may be its own excuse for beingvery naughtybut grandeur even when touching in its old decay is more than an excuse it is a vindication for the sins however great of all who are possessed of it and they were great in glory and splendour how great the men were who dwelt here in the olden golden time and how little idea has any man on earth in this age of small things of what it was to live in greatness though it were in great delusions’ as he said this’twas in the first dimness of twilighta breeze began to stir the palms and he heard the hoot of an owl which was reechoed far and far away by the monotonous and much more unmusical song of some arab peasant at his plough ‘i would like to know’ quoth flaxius ‘whether the song of the owl portends the death of that peasant or the song of the peasant the death of the owl methinks the owl has the worst of it for the ploughman hoots fifty per cent more horribly now of the nine thousand nine hundred and ninetynine divinations invented by kai umarat the first of the magi and first born of adam can i not find one here at hand to settle the weighty question’ as he said this while idly digging in the sand with his staff he struck something hard which shining seemed to be of bronze the sage picked it up and found he had unearthed an axe of the richest and deepest green patina ‘just the thing’ thought flaxius ‘thou comest as germans say “unto the call” it was by axiomancy or the balanced axe that the ancients were wont to decide a questionhalfpence to toss not having been then invented and i can bear pliny out in his assertion that the game was extremely fashionable in neolithic days they drew a circle bisected it with a line put the kelt in the middle and made it spin inferring from the way it pointed when at rest whether yes or no had been vouchsafed the thing still exists as a little game among american red indians they spun on their axes unde nomen derivatur the romans hung the hatchet with a cord and if i remember aright francesco della torre biana2 declares that the fall of jerusalem was thus predicted i wonder who predicted it’ whether it was from the ground or the tombs or the ruins or the great palmtree was not apparent but there was heard a hollow sound like no earthly voice but a sound as of wings there was a mocking tone in it which said ‘i with that axe which thou holdest in thy hand’ ‘and who in the name of desolation art thou who dwellest here in solitude’ inquired flaxius and the voice replied ‘aschmodai’ ‘what asmodeus the devil on two sticks well old friend i was a fool to put the question for i now remember and wierus has said it that thou art the demon of all games and gambling i would fain see thee again what ho chammadai sidonai aschmodai appear in the name of thy master amoimon’ ‘thou forgettest’ replied the voice more mockingly than before ‘that according to the pseudomonarchia dæmonum he who invokes asmodeus must stand firmly on his legs and call loudly’ ‘well’ replied the magian ‘i am seated firmly sur mon séant which will do just as well sans cérémonie among old friends and since thou hearest me it is loud enough come forth i say’ and lo there came forth from the doorway of the ruined temple an unearthly form in appearance awful and appalling but so strangely mingled with the grotesque a demon with the laughing nightmare that the wisdom of this our age and all its art of pen or pencil would have failed to depict it it paused in silence seeming like a statue and when the magian himself spoke it was not in words but with thought to the archdemon of delusion and of mockery ‘i see thee as thou art o spirit who wert once mighty to impose on man in so many forms o stupendous scarecrow of the past and its jester withal for the day is wellnigh gone by when mankind at large can grasp thy paradoxes yea they are rapidly becoming a vexation or a bore or a trifle as the idol of the past becomes the nursery toy of the present ‘truly there was a time when dante and milton and many more were to every word living truths for all who read them and the form was animated with the idea now the inferno burns no more pandemonium and theism and satan are all mere senile fables what remains is the art of the poetnothing morea beautiful petrified figurevery beautifulbutdead and thy spirit o daemon in its best meaning still lives in aristophanes and shakespeare and chaucer and rabelais and villon but the comprehension of it is dyingdying fast o daemonand ere long they too will be petrifactions wearing indeed the outward semblance of what they were but from them life will be gone men think that they still enjoy the poet in spirit and in truth but what they really enjoy is only their own criticisms and sense of vain intelligenceand with that the signs of death begin for where intelligence and selfknowledge awaken feeling for that which is without us ceases it was never meant that man should enjoy at once the two extremes of pleasureeven as the catholic moral casuist determined that man could not combine the extreme of passionate love with the holy sweetness of relationship yes the humour and absurdity and wild contrast which was the deepest problem in human nature become before criticism a poor shadowy thing and thus endeth the first lesson let me look a while longer into thy eyes o daemon and find a second’ and yet anon to flaxius as he gazed on the form it was as if he were looking through some wondrous arch into a vanity fairyland and advancing saw at every step newer and stranger arches richly and wildly adorned through which as in a marvellous vista he beheld infernos paradises fiddler’s greens edens tom tiddler’s grounds convents these he knew were lupanars witchburnings at which holy men sang hymns to god martyrdoms for smoke or the toss of a farthing millions killed in battles for quarrels about things which had no existence men and women tortured to death for not believing in nothing but a farceages following ages all mad with lies against nature and busy in it all was the spirit aschmodai or asmodeus whose business it is on earth to turn chance to mischief to inspire all the manias and follies and delusions which make men fools in every way and awaken in them vanity and error and it was no wonder that as he beheld him something like a vision or a song swept through the soul of flaxius for this was he ‘who grappled once with mighty solomon and cast him from his throne and then in turn was fettered heavily and made to work on the great temple of jerusalem to which he gave its last magnificence beyond the monarch’s hope yet jeered at all yea at his chains as at his victory and who as he was borne in fetters thus when all men deemed him sunk in deep despair burst out alaughing “wherefore art thou glad” inquired a sage he answered “lo i laughed because i saw a conjurer in the street who promised unto all his dupes to tell where buried treasure lay yet never knew that such a treasure lay beneath his feet even as he spoke during his conjuring” he too it was of old who tempted job nay there are rabbis who maintain today ’twas he who as the serpent tempted eve not out of evil but from mockery deeming the tree and all a mighty joke the farce primæval out of which has grown a thousandfarcèd series which men call the history of manwhich were indeed a mighty jest to devils as the frogs were to the boys of oldand might be too unto the baratrachians were not the pebbles which are cast so sharp and large yes in a thousand times ten thousand forms as mocking devil or as god supreme asmodeus is known unto the world’ ‘do not forget’ said asmodeus ‘my lastalbeit my weakest and most stagey and shallow incarnationthe mephistopheles of goethe yet he made me say one good thing when i call myself “der geist der stets verneint” do you know what verneint meansfor if you do you know more than most folk’ ‘i opine’ said flaxius ‘that it means “denies”’ ‘that and something more’ laughed asmodeus ‘verneinen meant of yore also to enchant conjure bewitch or humbug c’est mon métier i cast a spell on every work of man and make thereof in time a mockeryall mockery is denial in the enddenial is the bringing all to naught’ ‘truly from thy point of view thou hast seen rare jests in thy time aschmodai’ said flaxius ‘a history of the world written by thee with comments would be amusing readingas would the review thereof in the presbyterianand i could find it in my heart to wish a plague on ye both did i not know that there are some grains of truth between ye’ ‘ay i should catch it hot beyond a doubt’ replied asmodeus ‘for the less intellect a man has the more he believes in it and is therefore the more furious with those who mock the sublime wisdom in whose army he is a corporal but what thinkest thou flaxius of thought’ ‘i read not long ago’ replied the sage ‘an essay by a shephilosopher who said that as we ever deeper go into the subtlest mystery of things the more impossible it still becomes not to perceive an action as of mind working corelative with natural law the good girl left out of sight the small fact that thought and natural law may be one in nirvana it is a marvellous apparent law that man is not allowed to solve the problem as yet could he do so he would settle down into superstition or atheismboth unprogressive’ ‘ay’ quoth asmodeus ‘thought and natural law now carry one another alternately see the boys in florence when they play at scaricabarile one boy back to back with a rival locks arms with him and so they lift each other up and down3 ’tis a game much resembling polemics because in it both of the combatantswhether lifting or liftedappear by turns ridiculous’ ‘ah well’ replied flaxius ‘it is a vigorous game and developes muscle as does all struggling out of peaceful parthenogenesis and idleness starvation and the struggle for life evolve energy and male strength intellect and will but aschmodai what thinkest thou more of thought’ ‘though i was one of the very first thoughts ever thought if not the first itself as many think’ replied the spirit ‘the answer to that question is still unto me a mystery yet as we see that in life the crystal precedes the flower or organic growth monsters come before man egyptian pyramids before greek and gothic grace barbarism before enlightenment so do i deem that natural law preceded thought and involuntary action will which was first creatingness or a creator with the first motion in matter came the first act in the unorganic the organic was bornbut how this was it knew not nor do we know o my flaxius for truly there is an immense amount of things which it would be better for man to look after before he afflicts his small soul with the problem of the egg and the hen but so long as man shall make a fool of himself either as atheist theist or agnostic waiting to see how the fight will turn so that he the mugwump of faith may join the conqueroreven so long shall i aschmodai live in glory and triumph this trinity has been my very life even as alchemy drew from the spirit of the three its elixir vitæ and mighty have been the mockeries and many the jests which i have drawn from it nor is the merriment as yet quite o’eralbeit i know that i am perishingand passing with the triad fast away oh it was glorious to behold the jewthe original inventor of man’s vilest vanity chauvinism or national pride who first created religious oppression and believed with rabbi jochanan that “as the best of serpents deserves to have its head crushed so the best of gentiles ought to be killed”’tis sweet i say to live to hear him raise the martyr’s cry even as the pope is now raising it“the pooor pope”as a prisoner in the vatican then were the discoverers of the art of martyrdom avenged by seeing the humblest among them made the gods of the oppressors and so men all rolled on into time burning and torturing millions especially old women for the love of him whose one great doctrine was mercy charity love and sweetness then there were revolts of the oppressed and peasants’ wars and gladiators’ revolts and french revolutionsalternate black and whiteand in it all hell throve and i laughed’ ‘but thou art dying’ ‘well my flaxius i have had a call thou rememberest the tale of the three warnings or how death promised a man that he should be signalled thrice ere called away so he became lame and deaf and blindthese were the three’ ‘and when was thy first warning’ ‘when christ preached unconditional altruism unto mankindcosmopolitanism and equality that lamed me’ ‘and the second’ ‘when a hindu set up a religion on the word sikh it means “seek” what goes beyond faith unbelief or uncertainty is to inquire and search and seek for truth so i was deafened by that awful cry’ ‘and the third’ ‘aristotle friar bacon francis bacon darwin induction evolution that will soon finish me but the first blow was the worst and i knew it i bore up well and made a gallant fight but i am dying vicisti galilæe’ as he spoke the full golden syrian moon shone o’er their heads in an unclouded sky a gentle breeze was wantoning in the palms yet from afar there came a jackal’s cry and then the booming of a lion’s roar ‘i shall pass away my flaxius but i shall live again in some form evil or good my spirit cannot die for there is a good in mea good of strengthand while matter casts a shadow or contrasts and paradoxes exist i shall be all in a softened form i well previse as the sun which set is followed by yonder moon so shall i be softer and yet as eternal when god shall assume a higher form i shall inherit the old throne and sceptre’ ‘yes’ replied flaxius ‘it well may be shelley and sundry other inspired lunatics had that idea ’twas known to the greeks not without thy aid o aschmodai for thou hast always thrown doubt and a fine frenzy and confusion over all great truths’ ‘rectè dixisti thou speakest truly’ answered aschmodai ‘had all been all at once nothing had ever been’ son flaxius thou too art a moon and thou art my son but thou wouldst fain enjoy the paradox without the pain as the old hardgriping peasant grows rich unheeding of what misery he makes while his cultured heir grows gentle and amiable so wilt thou and the world which has been enriched by the past grow milder le diable est mortvive le diable ‘hæc fabula docet’ penned the sage ‘that men with all their wisdom do not train their wondrous power of putting numbers together to make sums or the faculty of deduction by means of which stupendous results of prophecy may be attained this might be increased to a degree which would seem to us miraculous edgar a poe had strange intuitions of what might be in his theory that he who observes all antecedents and possible combinations may surely foresee consequences ‘and as his name reminds me poe mentions that at palæchosi in sparta there is existent on a stone an inscription lasm which is probably a part of gelasma or laughter indicating a shrine to the merry god apropos of which m marcel schwob remarks that laughter is destined to die away with advancing culture “it is” he declares “a mere tic a gross physical manifestation of the perception of disharmony in the world which will vanish before complete scepticism absolute science general pity or intolerance of suffering and respect for all things” this idea should assuredly please angloamericans among whom while a sense of humour increases the laugh diminishes till we generally find in their greatest jesters men who never laugh at all ‘but m schwob errs in his essai de paradoxe sur le rire when he declares that this species of contraction of the zygomatic muscles is peculiar to man it having been an indication of his feeble intelligence and the conviction of his own superiority the newfoundland dog laughs at times and that with an expression which is completely human i had heard of this several times before i witnessed it and also heard that the expression though droll was so uncanny in a dog as to awaken something like awe as i indeed experienced these dogs have a keen sense of humour entering with intelligence into the games and romps of boys but the error of m schwob as well as that of matthew arnold is to believe that seriousness or mere gravity is essential to genius the french writer is of opinion that laughter expresses only sneers sarcasms vanity and shortwitted scepticism it means far more than this to greater minds as the schwobian view is diabolical so is there on the other hand a divine humour a sweet and sacred gelasma which we only do not associate with sacred things and grandeur simply because we know nothing about their true inner nature and are not at home there there is a sweet laughter of innocence purity and youth in which a smile always irradiates the face lighting it to higher beauty is not a smile divine is not all beauty as the smile of god in nature and there is also a bitter smilea sardonic laughthe very life of aschmodai and the meaning of this chapter is that this laugh is vanishing in the world and with it the brutal bray and idiotic ‘yawp’ and silly snigger of the vulgar mind but that the merry musical laugh of the gentle heart and the smile divine which thrills the heart of love like wine will remain to man after asinine seriousness shall have vanished for ever ’tis a delicate thing to draw the lines which divide the gold from the dross and show how the harsh humour will be neglected in shakespeare and rabelais as theology is dropped from our admiration of dante but all of them will live in so far as the angelic smile beams in them note that had this world been without variableness or the shadow of turning darkness and light or night and day rise and fall it had not been at all and that while there shall be change and contrast and evolution or nature itself there will be humour which is the soul and life of laughter and though it has been easily checked in this priggish fin de siècle when dolts have wellnigh got the upper hand and dismal dulness shadows all the land yet with the great coming renaissance of nature which is just beginning to show under the aid of science as the morning redness comes with the rising sun men will laugh merrily once more not in bitterness but in love 2

their songs the glow of sunset bright or meteors on the wing’ the following story belongs to this book ‘in good faith of all sorts’ be it salted pickled or sugared since it was originally the first ever recorded of the great and good flaxius but as it was of florence florentiny so following the saying ‘first come first served’ and being engaged on the legends of florence4in which book the lovers of romance and the occult will find many a rare treat showing how all florence is a charmingly haunted citytherefore did i first introduce the sage in it to the world and in the introduction i said that the legend is of great antiquity since there is a hint of it in an ancient hebrew work by rabbi ben mozeltoff or the learned rev gedauler chamar besides being found in poetic form in my own great work the music lesson of confucius also in a marvellous cabalistic manuscript which i bought in sight of santa maria novella which describes how the bathkol or daughter of the voice may be caused to be heard within our soul and teach us all kinds of magic money is the root of all evil and flaxius who went to the root of everything of course wanted it how he often got it is set forth as follows flaxius and the rose midnight was ringing from the cloister of san miniato in florence on the hill above and flaxius sat by the arno down below on the bank by the square grey tower of other days known as the niccolò or torre della trinità because there are in it three arches it was midnight in midwinter and a full moon poured forth all its yellow light over florence as if it would fain preserve it in oilor amberand over the olive groves till they looked in the distance like mossagates in topaz ‘or i’ quoth flaxius to carry out the simile ‘like a fly in hock’ yes it was a clear cold tuscan night and as the last peal of bells went out into eternity and faded in the irrevocable thousands of spirits of the departed began to appear thronging like fireflies in june through the streets visiting their ancient haunts and homes shops and shades greeting gossiping or arranging their affairs just as the peasants do on friday in the great place of the signoriaas they have done for centuries flaxius looked at the rolling river which went rushing by at his feet and said ‘arno mio you are in a tremendous hurry to get to the sea and all the more because you have just had an accessit a remittance of rain from the mountainbanks buon pro vi faccia much good may it do you so every mortal fain would rise and run so every shopman hurries to become a great merchant when he gets some money and every farmer a signore and every signore a great lord and every great lord a ruler at court and over all the landprorsum et sursum and when they get there or when you get to the sea then ye are all swallowed up in greater lives interests and actions and so the rivers run for ever onlonger yet ever seeming less unto yourselves and soad altiora tendunt omnes sicall to the higher ever doth aspire the floweredged torrent and the florentine’ when he suddenly heard above his head a spiritvoice clear sweet and strange singing not in words or on the ear but by tones of unearthly music of which languages there are many among the unearthlies each unto its ‘chaos’ all being wordless songs or airs suggesting speech and yet conveying ideas more rapidly it was the goblin of the tower to him of the tower next beyond on the further hill and he said ‘how many ghosts there are abroad tonight’ ‘yes it is a fine night for ghosting moonlight is midsummer for them poor souls but i say brother who is yonder frate the dark monkspectre who always haunts your tower lingering here and there about it what is the spell upon that spirito’ ‘he is one to be pitied’ replied the goblin of the trinità ‘he was a good fellow while he lived but a little too fond of money he was afflicted with what the doctors called in rome when i was young the amor sceleratus or sal aeratus habendi so it came to pass that he died leaving a treasure mille aureos or a thousand gold crowns buried in my tower unknown to any one and for that he must walk the earth until some one living wins the money for money is as life to all men and he who destroys it is in a way a murderer’ flaxius pricked up his ears he understood all that the goblins said but they had no idea that the man in a scholar’s robe who sat below knew goblinese ‘what must a mortal do to get the gold’ inquired the second goblin ‘truly he must do what is wellnigh impossible’ replied the elf of the tower ‘for he must without the aid of magicnote thatbring to me here in this month of january a fresh fullblown rose’ the voices were silent a cloud passed over the face of the moon the river rushed and roared on flaxius sat in a vandykebrown study thinking how he could obtain peace and repose for the ghostly monk and also get the solatium or reward ‘here is’ he thought ‘aliquid laborare something to be worked out now is the time and here is the chance ingirlandisi di lauro to win the laurel wreath a rose in january what a pity it is not four hundred years later when people will have greenhouses and bluenosed vagabonds will be selling red roses all the winter long in the tornabuoni faith it is sometimes inconvenient to be behind or in advance of the age ‘eureka i have it’ he at last exclaimed ‘have it by the neck and tail i will spogliar la tesoria rob the treasury and spoil the egyptian si non in errore versatus sum unless i am stupendously mistaken monk thy weird will soon be dreed thy penance prophesied will soon be o’er’ saying this he went into the city and there the next day going to a fair lady of his acquaintance who excelled all in italy in ingenious needlework he had made of silk a rose and so deftly was it done that had it been put on a bush you would have sworn that a nightingale would have sung to it or a bee sought to ravish it then going to a venetian perfumer’s in the via vacchereccia close by the signoria the wise flaxius had his flower well scented with best attar of roses from constantinople and when midnight struck he was at the tower once more where he called to the goblin ‘che vuoi what dost thou seek’ cried the elf ‘the treasure of the monk’ ‘bene give me a rose’ ‘ecco there it is’ replied flaxius extending it ‘non facitit won’t do’ answered the goblin in latin thinking flaxius to be a monk ‘it is a sham rose of silk artificially colouredmurice tincta est’ ‘smell it’ replied flaxius calmly ‘the smell is all right and sweet i admit’ answered the guardian of the gold ‘the perfume is delicious’here he sniffed at it seriously being like all of his kind enraptured with perfume‘and that much of it is i grant the real thing’ ‘then tell me truly’ replied flaxius ‘and swear by thy great ancestress diana the mother of the spirits of the night and her sisterdaughter herodias and her nine cats by the moon and her eternal shadow endamone and the word which bergoia whispered into the ear of the ox and the nails of nortia and the lamia whom thou lovestwhat is it makes a man is it his soul or his body’ ‘man of mystery and master of the old etruscan hidden lore’ replied the awestruck goblin ‘it is his soul’ ‘and is not the perfume of the rose its soul that which breathes its life in which it speaks to fairies or to men is not the voice in song or sweetened words the perfume of the spirit ever true is not’ ‘i give it up’ replied the goblin ‘the priest may turn in now for a long long nap here take his gold and may you have a merry time with it there is a great deal of good drinking in a thousand crowns to say nothing of the eating do you ever play at dice old man ludere latrunculis when you do i promise you three sixes by the way i’ll just keep this rose to remember you by addio a rivederla goodbye and au revoir’ so the bedesman slept among his ashes cold and flaxius who was a stout carl for the nonce with a broad back and a great beard returned bearing a mighty sack of ancient gold which stood him in good stead for many a day and the goblin is still there in the tower ‘hæc fabula docet’ wrote flaxius as he revised the proof with a red pencil for which he had paid a penny at ancora’s ancient stationery shop in the via condotti ‘this tale teaches that in this life there is naught which hath not its ideal side or idol innersoul which may raise us to high reflection or great profit if we will but seek it ‘the lower the man the less he sees and the lower he looks but it is all to his loss ‘now every chapter in this book or in that of thy life o my son or daughter may seem to thee to be only a rose of silk yet do not stop at that but try to find therein its perfume ‘for thou art thyself i doubt not such a rose even if thy threads as in most of us be somewhat worn or torn or faded and yet thou hast a soul far better than many deem who see thee only from a distance and this my book is written for the perfume not the silk of my reader and there is no person who is better in any way than what the world deems him or her to be who will not find in it comfort’ but friend how was it that it came to pass that i found out this veritably and authentically ancient legend of the tower of the triple arches which when i wrote rose opposite my window over the arno my dear reader it was written down for me by a witch in very truth who had learned it of her strange kind and with it many more which you might have collected as well as i if you could have kept such company and wandered in such paths as i did and know that the sleepy hollow of the hudson is not more haunted by marvellous spirits of a bygone age or more strangely shaded with legends of goblins and fair quaint mysteries of the golden time than is this city which is named from flowers or it may be from flora la belle romaine the beautiful sorceress who bewitched all with love villon asked what became of her ‘where is there left on earth a trace of flora once the roman fair or archipiada and thais that bright and ever queenly pair echo will fling the question back o’er silent lake and streamlet lone all earthly beauty fades away where have the snows of winter gone’ here the old roman enchantress yet lives as much as she ever did in fact in romefor she was there only a worldold indian myth of pleasure and beautyin the city of the lily and here indeed there is according to legend a goblin by every bridge an elf in every tower and old palazzo a fairy of the ancient roman kind in form changed to a later hue in colour a witch aura lingering in many a darkling corridor and chamber a something between sweet perfume and the conjurer’s fumigations to raise spirits i have learned that in my barber’s shop opposite the great column of cosimo san zenobio once wrought a miracle and in my café a fair maid was bewitched into a cow ‘all over doth this modern life an ancient life enfold’ these things you may read in full in many a story as set forth in the aforesaid legends of florence which grew out of the first draft of the sketch of flaxius 4 legends of florence 2 vols london d nutt flaxius and the emperor julian ‘the emperor julian in his cæsars gives the preference to marcus aurelius who having been greatly honoured for his merits replied modestly “that it had always been his care to imitate the gods”’the spectator no 635 ‘i should really like’ said flaxius to his attendant pocketimp puttuli ‘to see this grand young man our emperor julian’ ‘grand jeune homme’ was a term applied in later days to mr james g bennett of the new york herald by the figaro but flaxius was the inventor of it’ ‘nothing easier’ replied the goblin ‘you give the atriensis or janitor a hundred nummos or sestertios or a ring or any trifle and so you may be admitted to a privatepublic view for a sestertium he will manage an opportunity to speak to cæsar but you can have a good street view for nothing and i think’ added puttuli as he critically eyed his master ‘if he saw you he might speak to you he isn’t at all particular as to his company’ ‘gratias tibi ago thank you for the compliment’ replied the sage ‘but as it concerns an emperor we may as well do things genteelly assume a respectable form if you know how’ ‘gratias tibi or not tibi ago’ murmured the imp ‘and hire a place dans la première loge for a sestertium’ ‘would your excellency like to carry a bouquet’ inquired puttuli impudently ‘a good idea yes order me one of rue concordia and verbena’ ‘well of all the nosegays that ever were nosed that is the queerest’ answered the servant ‘but fiat voluntas tua my lord’s will be done a great deal of rue with plenty of concordia and most of all verbena i will go to the pretty herbseller in the suburra she has the vegetables’ ‘i must choose a lucky day’ said flaxius ‘tomorrow’ answered puttuli ‘is the three hundred and sixtyfifth day of the year three hundred and sixtyfive ad’ so it came to pass that twentyfour hours after flaxius stood in the grand hall of the imperial palace amid the row of suitors and courtiers and other great or wise or otherwise folk who awaited audience of julian he looked at the emperor with approbation ‘i knew the first julian’ he reflected ‘the man who bought the empire at auction and resigned in sixtysix days he was indeed a caducusa word which will live in later days as cadan imperial snob this is a horse of another colour’ meanwhile the emperor who had the keenest eye in rome for observing all sorts and conditions of men and who after sitting an hour in the amphitheatre could describe the appearance of everybody present who was anybody had not failed to note the tall and stately form of the philosopher and his grandly flowing beard now julian having a very fine beard of his own was deeply interested in this subject as appears from his great work misopogon meaning ‘enemy of the beard’ that is to say of wisdom to say nothing of his ‘letters’ and as flaxius had a very beard of beards flowing and curling in indescribable magnificence and as he wore the purely white longflowing robe which indicated the professional philosopher a being dearer to the emperor than the prettiest woman living he gazed at flaxius with what became absolute approval or admiration ‘by esculapius and jupiter’ he exclaimed ‘that is a goodlooking man something in my line i think who is he’ ‘cæsar’ replied puttuli who had assumed the form and voice of bumbulbulus the court factotum ‘that is the great flaxius a sage who has travelled all over the world and who is reported to know everything from the works of moloch the pismirist up to those of god’ ‘that is a large order’ replied the emperor reflectively ‘magnum postulatum est but bring him here that i may measure him’ ‘that will take more time o cæsar than it would for him to measure you’ thought puttuli as he departed ‘he needs a long line who would sound such a sea as the master come now i think we are as good as established at court’ now the emperor had for many years been devoted to magic and occulta and observing the herbbouquet which flaxius bore grasped its hidden meaning with great pleasure ‘salve cæsar’ said the sage ‘salve adepte’ replied the monarch ‘so thou hast mastered the lore of the etruscan as i read by the concordia “janus adorandus cum quo concordia mitis” as ovid saith of egypt as the rue proclaims “cingebat rutæ quæ coma multicomæ’ and of persia i see by the verbena verbenasque adole pinguis et mascula thura hem virgil’ ‘i have heard even in the remotest region of the earth’ replied flaxius ‘that what cæsar could not do in the way of apt quotation was not worth doing’ ‘um i flatter myself that i know a thing or two’ replied the emperorthe very phrase occurs in his epistolæ‘but like apicius with the british oysters i am always ready for a few more and i read it in thee o flaxius’ he added suddenly changing his whole mien and manner and looking through his tangled locks with that strange unearthly glare which so impressed his contemporary familiars as if he had become another man ‘that thou canst teach me much which i do not know therefore i ask thee to sup with me tonight’ the emperor said this turning away so abruptly that all present who did not know his ways inwardly thanked god according to their heathen or christian faith that they did not stand in the shoes of that philosopher with the flowing beard but those who knew him better looked gravely and said ‘cæsar hath found a new friend’ but flaxius himself was deeply amazed when julian leading him to a table by which stood a single greek servantthere was no other soul presentshowed him with some pride that the meal consisted only of a grilled fish and garum with bread and olives new cheese and fruit ‘there is your supper flaxius’ he exclaimed ‘and much good may it do you’ ‘by the lance and laurel bough or olive of the god honour whose temple is by the campidoglio’ cried the sage ‘what am i o cæsar that thou shouldst treat me with such esteem’ ‘non rectis oculis aspice never do you mind that’ replied julian ‘truly if i were going to entertain a bythnian prince or a sowbellied contractor for the army whom i hoped some day to crucify i would have given him a hundred courses of ortolans stuffed with oysters and galantine with truffles and pistachios and all that sort of thing but to a philosopher whom i wish to treat as a brother i give just what i am accustomed to eat myself one cannot be a slave at the same time to his brain and his bellynon potes tethidem simul et galateam amare as lucian says’ ‘now i see’ reflected flaxius ‘that when a man is a gentleman at heart he can turn even his vanity to a kindness a marvellous character is this cæsar and one who will do much to be misunderstood in history’ so they held wondrous discourse of great and glorious things in philosophy over which the emperor quoted nearly all the orphic sayings with the poemander of hermes and finally came to what he had been aiming at from the first by bluntly asking ‘knowest thou aught of magic’ ‘o cæsar do not think i seek to quibble or raise a sophistical cloud between us’ replied flaxius ‘if i ask thee what is the meaning of magic’ ‘it is’ replied the emperorwho had been there before‘the violation of the laws of nature’ ‘and what is nature’ asked the sage ‘h’mthe eternal order of thingsthe action of laws or potentia quatenus in potentia’ ‘rather vague yet good so far as it goes but cæsar if there be but one substance though you call it matter in one form and spirit in another and one eternal law manifesting itself in infinite forms there can be no violation of them miracle or magic is only something which man cannot explain something which puzzles and astonishes him si placetgive me an example for a miracle’ ‘i am devilish thirsty’ replied julian ‘that garum or fishsauce is pungent enough to make a nazarene drink a gallon of strong sicilian wine now if you could pour me any kind of wine which i may call for out of one and the same bottle ‘it may be done o cæsar but remember that to do this one must invoke the invisible spirits or forces of nature whom we call the gods to aid in such mysteries’ after a long pause of reflection the emperor slowly replied ‘granted’ he did not see that puttuli reduced to his natural stature of three inches and who sat unseen behind him advanced his thumb to his nose and waved his fingers making thereby an ancient and mysterious egyptian sign used by the priests of memphis when they initiated some great sage to their rites then flaxius winked to puttuli who presently reappeared in the form of bumbulbulus ‘go to my rooms’ said the sage ‘and bring hither the ancient goblet of bacchus’ the goblin obeyed and returned with a very large bottle of black cuir bouilli or moulded leather it was of graceful shape apparently of great antiquity covered with exquisite silver relief representing the deeds of bacchus handling it with great reverence flaxius pronounced over it in a voice which was halfsinging such as one may hear to this day among witches in italy when they chant the following incantation to bacchus ‘golden master of the earth king of joy and lord of mirth by thy mother the divine of the ancient cadmean line semele of earth the pride who of jove’s great splendour died by the seasons who in truth nursed thee from thy early youth or fair ino who they say brought thee from arabia by the lion’s form you wore when gods and titans fought of yore and by the holy miracle of which the morning poets tell when from naxos thou didst sail with a gentle favouring gale and pirates sought to conquer thee but fell into captivity by the hour when thou did’st go to the darkling realms below and brought thy mother “ever bright” to the upper world of light and all that nonnus ever sung of thee with mystic golden tongue i conjure theethe alldivine to give me what i ask of wine’ saying this he took a small gold cup and said ‘now cæsar ask for what wine thou wilt’ ‘let it be cæcuban’ replied the emperor then flaxius poured forth wine from the bottle into the cup and extended it to julian ‘cæcuban it is sure enough’ replied the emperor when he had drunk to the last drop which he poured super naculum upon his thumbnail ‘wilt thou have another draught’ inquired flaxius ‘if soof what’ ‘falernian’ answered the emperor ‘sit’ replied flaxius ‘here you are but o cæsar i have not hung an ivy garland as yet round the cup as the conjuration requires’ ‘vino vendibili suspensâ hederâ nihil opus good wine needs no bush’ answered julian ‘the miracle is wrought and i wish that all were as agreeable and now flaxius since thou sayest that all miracles can be explained by natural causes i pray thee to naturalise me this for verily ut turris super omnes it is a huckleberry above my persimmon and i would like to know how it is done’ ‘easily enough o cæsar the bottle is made from a certain flexible substance and it contains many chambers or cells in each of which there is a different kind of wine when i press on any one of these it pours forth its content’ ‘then the incantation was all gammon’ remarked julian ‘not so o cæsar it made the miracle’ ‘humumumump’ replied the monarch ‘and yet flaxius it still seems to me that there are and must be miracles surpassing all human skill and knowledge which the utmost wisdom cannot compass or explain and never will’ ‘can your greatness give me an example’ replied flaxius ‘it is written in thine own ancient etruscan chronicles’ replied julian ‘that in the early time the mysterious nymph begoe or bergoia before the world and in the capitol slew an ox by whispering in his ear a single word now i believe that had i tried i might have worked out an explanation of thy holy bottle but in the miracle of bergoia i have reflected many a time and oft without solving it and therefore do i conclude that it was a violation of the laws of nature’ ‘o cæsar’ replied flaxius ‘great is the man who can infallibly decide where human reason leaves off and divinity begins for nusquam est qui ubique est that which is everywhere is nowhere and this is true of miracle but what if i perform for theeopenly before all thy courtand all rome if thou wilt that same miracle’ ‘by hercules’ cried julian amazed and delighted beyond measure his wild and mysterious eyes gleaming so as to make a very respectable miracle of their own if he had but known it ‘thou art a man of gold set with gemsthe first real sage i ever found in the stuffing of this duck of a world and you really will in good faithhonestus indicusslay the ox with a whisper’ ‘thou shalt see it o cæsar’ replied flaxius ‘but it seems to me that the miracle would be improved on if instead of an ox we were to substitute a man for it might be said by the sceptical that we had poisoned the ox beforehand’ ‘by medea’ exclaimed the emperor admiringly ‘i never thought of that’ ‘while if we take a man who declares himself to be in good health there can be no suspicion now cæsar thou hast i doubt not in thy prisons more than one unlucky wretch condemned to the torture and the crucifix to whom a quick and painless death would be as a divine blessing and great joy’ ‘depone bet your head on it’ cried julian ‘i sent one this morning to the mamertinehell would be too good for himand i meant to give him a foretaste of it by means of preparation’ ‘he will do’ replied flaxius so on the following day when the emperor and his court and all rome assembled in the great amphitheatre there was led in a ferocious giantlike and bitterly wickedlooking gaul who expecting to be tortured to death to make a roman holiday was on his best behaviour as regards defiance and dying game ‘man whence comest thou’ asked flaxius ‘from lutetia’ was the proud reply ‘ame de boue’ thought the sage in a language of the future and then asked ‘and what is thy religion’ ‘i worship the devil it was the last fashion ere i left home’ ‘you expect torture’ ‘i do not fear it it will pain me but when dead i shall be amply revenged on ye all if hate and hell can do it’ ‘if i could give thee out of pity a sudden painless death wouldst thou declare that thou in all thy health and strength forgivest all men’ the gaul glared at him stolidly and grimly and then uttered in a strange tongue which none understood ‘mais nom d’une pipe pourquoi pas j’aurais bien de quoi m’amuser sans me soucier de ces blà’ and then in rude latin he said ‘i consent hurry along with your washing and get the pigs in’ and he made the declaration then flaxius who bore in his hand a long wand as all the magi were wont to do touched him with it while whispering a word in his ear and the man fell dead at full length while a thrill of awe and a murmur rose from all rome at sight of this mighty deed and the great and wise and even the good or such few of the latter as were present rari nantes thronged about him and adored him ‘and now flaxius’ said the emperor as they sat in solemn concert over the holy bottle which his highness was never tired of admiring ‘if thou canst explain to me on natural grounds how thou didst slay that gaul then “by gaule” as julius cæsar said to vercingetorix i will believe or disbelieve anything’ ‘yea cæsar i will do it’ replied the sage ‘now if thou wilt remember begoe or bergoia her who slew the ox with a single word left to rome a book on the ars fulguritorum or the averting that is to say managing thunder and lightning and this book which is in the ancient etruscan tongue and hard to understand for those who know the language is even yet in the temple of the palatine apollo where i read it and it explains that the lightning is caused by an invisible but terrible secret force which like heat pervades all things while seen by none and this is the awful power of the divinity to smite the earth and it was by means of it that bergoia slew the ox and know that there was in my wand a charge of condensed thunder and lightning quite strong enough to knock a bull skyhigh’ ‘but the word’ asked julian who had not quite recovered from his ideas of miracle ‘truly cæsar the word was electricity which is as yet unknown but which in ages to come will be the great heritage and power of mankind for as when thou art done with a garment thou givest it to a servant so the gods when they have somewhat worn out their attributes and glories hand them over to men’ ‘semper similem ducit deus ad similem and so the gods lead ever like to like ah it is wonderful and now flaxius the light begins to shine in on me and i see that there is indeed a higher and far more wonderful magic and miracle than the poor thin thaumaturgy which i sought for once for true magic is the mastering the awful power and secrets of nature now i see that because thou mightest explain to me by natural means how christ fed the multitude or raised the dead or healed the sick it would be none the less wonderful for genius even the genius to amaze and nothing more is miraculous’ ‘that will be better understood o cæsar in times to come when science shall have risen to glory by means of such stupendous genius that no man can help revering it’ ‘ah’ said julian with a deep sigh ‘happy the age and happy mankind when there shall be but one faith whatever it be thou wilt never know what i have suffered between the old faith in the gods and christianity as terence says i think somewhere in the andria ‘“how happy could i be with either were t’ other dear charmer away”’ ‘yes cæsar yours is a hard case and all the harder because you wish heart and soul to do what is right’ ‘orcus and hell heathen and christian take me if i don’t’ replied the emperor in a passion and looking as wild as a panther on the spring he who had seen him then and there would have believed him to be some young god enraged ‘what the devil can they expect a man to do who has seen what i have seen and gone through what i have endured well i began in good faith enough as a christian and in truth i was cut out for one as few young roman gentlemen are i was never sensual cruel nor overselfish’ ‘right you are o cæsar’ thought flaxius ‘and a very good christian gentleman you’d have made if your guardians had let well alone’ ‘so i with a deep love of ancient heathen beauty and art and poetry was put into a cloister where the meanest monkish shaveling spite made a sin and a shame of all that i loved it was not belief in their own faith but the bitterest hate of what they called heathenism which chiefly inspired every one of them that was their real religionall the rest was mere formthe adaptation to their ritual of what i knew were old oriental ceremonies then i began to think out o flaxius what has ever since been the idea of my life why cannot man keep the old faith in beauty and all that was charming in the old religion and unite with it the humanity and higher truth of christianity’ ‘there will perhaps be a time in the dim and remote future’ quoth flaxius prophetically quoting gladstone ‘when that idea will occur to others’ ‘so i dreamed that i as an eclectichaving read something of ammonius saccas the egyptianwould be the apostle of the new combined religion well time passed and after i had become cæsar it occurred to me to examine all the faiths into which christianity had split and a nice job it was pheugh everything from trinitarians arians and unitarians down to cainites who worship the flesh and sin and the devil all hating the common enemy but hating one another worse like the jews who slew one another in the siege of jerusalem while all fought titus ‘o sage’ he resumed ‘when i think how beautiful and noble how holy and perfect were the conceptions of christ and how it was his ideal that every man should commune directly with god and when i see how each one of these sects steps in and proposes with saints and forms to do for you what you should do for yourself i cannot wonder at the scarcity of christians yet there is a stupendous truth in christianity the truth of human rights which even they cannot crush magna est veritas et prævalebit’ ‘and the old religion’ asked flaxius ‘well it admitted the beautiful and let a man philosophise freely and did not make devils out of all the sweet and fair conceptions of poetry of fauns and nymphs and oreads and all and so as i believe that nature must prevail in the end with man i went back to it yet the old religion is not humane it admits slavery and inhumanity it allows the grosser passions of cruelty and lust full play evil nature as well as good and it needs reform i would fain be that reformer’ ‘now here is a great man’ thought flaxius ‘who is either two hundred years behind his time or a thousand or more in advance of it he means well but is out of the age’ then speaking aloud he said ‘cæsar there was once a king of bithynia or cappadocia or some such country who had a mind to marry now the king next door had two daughters both were beautiful but one was as venus and the other as minerva one was beautiful and voluptuous witty and charming while the other was wise and just humane and ever careful that no one should be oppressed now which of these should he have married’ ‘had i been in his place i would have married both’ replied the emperor ‘but that was impossible’ ‘h’m well in that case i should have taken the wise one’ ‘that’ said flaxius ‘is what he did and it is what the world will do it will adopt the religion which despite all the corruption with which man surrounds it promises the greatest good to the greatest number’ ‘i believe that thou art in the right o sage’ replied the emperor slowly ‘however jacta est alea the die is cast and i shall ever remain julian the apostate but what will be the end of it all’ ‘thou wilt die nobly as a king should diein battle for thy country’ ‘then’ said julian ‘i am content’ flaxius in hades showing how flaxius went down into hell and of the marvellous things which he saw and learned while there ‘to the esthete who regards all nature and eternity as a mere paintbox for art hell is a necessity as is illustrated by ruskin when he howls that “in the utmost solitudes of nature the existence of hell seems to me as legibly declared by a thousand spiritual utterances as that of heaven”’ ‘they manage these things’ said flaxius ‘i verily believe better in hell’ ‘you have been in hell i suppose’ said the goblinsnob with the most civilly impertinent air in the world to the sage ‘strange’ reflected flaxius ‘that a place which may be readily reached in a minute if we may believe the common exhortation of the vulgar or even in an instant by the aid of electricity as they manage it in americawith i forget how many volts but “in a demivolt”should be unknown to me i must consult the fairy decidedly my education has been neglected i have not yet made the grand tour’ flaxius was living then near a town in the austrian tyrol in a lonely grey and ancient ivied tower and small house hidden away in the mountains and there with his usual disregard for appearances he had installed a small gypsy family whom he had found camped in the woods three chairs a table and a stupendous service of gold plate this last not for luxury but because it was the first which as a buried treasure near by came to hand the goblin of the tower had revealed to him its existence and he used it because it saved him the trouble of going to town for crockery his servants had instructions whenever sent to buy anything to steal one half the money and then half of what they bought under penalty of severe punishment which had the natural result that whenever they could do so without detection they never stole anything once indeed when his boy lajos impudently brought him a manifestly superabundant supply of fruit for a half florin or more than he expected did flaxius proceed i cannot say to spoil the child for the young devil was beyond all spoiling but to break a rod on him whereupon he fell on his knees in tears but was pardoned on promising never to be honest any more even flaxius great as he was could not have his own way in everything for things got to such a pitch at last that these gypsies would tell the truth before his very face openly with the utmost impunity and even without blushing it was midnight and flaxius the immortal sat alone in his baronial hall true it was only about twenty feet in length and fifteen in breadth but it was a hall the walls were rich or at least ragged with romanpicturesque and verymuchbattered stone carvings representing a lettucelike confusion of crockets and finials in which were nestled angels as ugly as devils and devils not much prettier than the angels like crayfish or écrevisses in foliage the whole resembling an early christian or preraphaelite salad which would have enchanted a gothiconolator there was in the hall a large black cat and an owl both of whom had come in uninvited from the without and joined the family on speculation from a desire for human sympathy and love also for mice and any little edible odds and ends which might be obtainable there was too a florid chimneypiece so large that the hall seemed to be only a portion of it or adjunct just as the body and tail of the pricklefish seem to be only a part of his vast ogival jaw in it blazed a fire and by or in that fire sat the house goblin his name was slangbrand and he was engaged in swallowing live coals and then blowing out a storm of sparks from his nose or de retroas ye may see exemplified in callot’s picture of saint anthonyanon swallowing the poker like a juggler and then rising and falling on the smoke up and down the chimney like a ball in a fountain to the great admiration of the cat and the owl who constituted his audience then flaxius himself took a coal from the fire placed it on a small silver dish on the table and sprinkled on it a powder which burned emitting an intensely aromatic and most agreeable but strange perfume the magian meanwhile murmuring an incantation a beautiful soft light diffused itself all over the room ’twas like a delicate rosy aurora with a memory of moonlight and not without stars for in it shone two celestial eyes and then anon the fairy stood revealed to her worshipper ‘joyful greeting to thee flaxius’ said the fata ‘deepest reverence to thee o loveliest in form as in spirit of all thy kind’ replied the magian in a tone of deep sincerity ‘and how goes the world with thee’ inquired his queen ‘with the world ever something new as of old as for me and it was for this that i summoned thee i would fain go’ ‘go whither’ inquired the fairy ‘go to hell’ replied flaxius ‘wherefore this unprovoked hostility’ asked the spirit ‘it was not spoken in the vocative’ replied flaxius ‘i did but indicate the route which i fain would take not commend it to thee though by the twelve gods’ he added passionately ‘happy indeed would he be who on such a journey could meet with such an eurydice’ ‘flaxius’ replied the fair one ‘thou hadst ever so much modesty as to declare thyself unfit for heaven and too much pride to allow that thou wert fit for the lower regions therefore didst thou elect to remain on earth to study and master its problems as thoroughly as it was in thee to do so maintaining that of the few magians who like thyself had mastered immortality too few prepared themselves as they should do by studying the rudiments’ ‘ay’ replied flaxius with his worldly smile ‘they are mostly like boys who would fain run straight from their school to their dinner not tarrying just for a little wholesome exercise to give a better appetite and health but the truth which forces itself on me more and more is that hell and earth are so nearly allied that it becomes more and more difficult every day to investigate the one without knowing the other even as a knowledge of chemistry becomes essential to an astronomer’ ‘you are quite right’ replied the fairy ‘sit tibi voluntas you shall have your wish fortunately it is extremely easy to get there especially to obtain a place as permanent boarder but even as a casual visitor i can assure you special honour all the great geniuses of yore made a three days’ visit to the realm it was a ceremony de rigueur a kind of court presentation which no wellbred immortal could omit i do not consider’ she added reflectively ‘that hell is exactly the place to which i would recommend parents to send their boys for an education but for men of intelligence there are a great many valuable ideas to be picked up there and when would you depart’ ‘now if you please’ ‘said and done then’ answered the spirit ‘dicto citius as virgil used to say to youin un batter d’occhioin un balenin un amen ‘in a wink and in a flash in a snap and at a dash while a priest “amen” could say from this earth now pass away to the mystic world below which all men dread yet none do know’ as she uttered this incantation flaxius sank back in his great armchair to a deep sleep the fairy looked at him with a loving glance evidently with earnest and sympathetic thought kissed his forehead and softly sighed ‘ah well eternity is long’ and turning to the goblin she said ‘slang take heed that no mortal enters this house for three days and nights and see that the master here be not disturbed and do ye’ she added to the owl and cat ‘take care also that no noise be made hereabouts and if ye do your work well ye shall become witch and wizard in human form farewell’ saying this she winged her way heavenward ‘to the joyous realms afar where the angel dwellers are’ now of the four members of that happy family it would have been difficult to say who was the most delighted flaxius surely because he had been sent to hell the owl and cat certainly because they hoped to rise to the most degraded state of humanity or slang assuredly simply because he had been spoken to by a queen and charged with a commission and the three latter solemnly swore among themselves that if a mouse or bird so much as ventured to cheep or chirp about the house they would rend it limb from limb and have it served up for supper according to the penal code of the goblins v cxxxiiiv libro alto capitulo nullo folio nigro as all the richest and most artistic or artful adornment of cathedrals or palaces diamonded with panes of quaint device ‘innumerable of stains and splendid dyes’ and twilight saints and dim emblazonings with half unearthly holy elfin shade is all as trash and gingerbread compared to the greenwood with its ineffable beauties of summer and golden glory of autumn so is all earthly music ever played mere scrannelpiping contrasted with that in which the soul of flaxius seemed swept away as he sank to sleep under the spell of the fairy for he always loved music in every form however made or by what mind composed and that which now seemed to be life itself and waft him on was what he would have had idealised for him or that which he would have wanted had he known how to want it this fulfilment of ideals in every form was the introduction to and the great moral lesson of inferno for therein lies such temptation as is mercifully spared to man on earth ‘by the glory of the gods’ said flaxius rousing himself to strength ‘if the devil can bring art like this to bear on common mortals who the devil can be saved truly it was high time for me to get out of the ruts of earth for a season when there are such tremendous paradoxes as this to solve outside it and i thought that the problem and puzzle and contrast and anomaly were confined to lifeme stupide verily i say unto myself flaxius that i foresee i shall find the very humour of humour in the mystery of hell as this music intimates’ and the music dying away yet not quite vanishing for flaxius while he was in inferno always heard itjust as in a garden we scent perfume of some kind rising or fallinghe found himself on the summit of a marvellously pleasant hill amid rocks and trees grass and wildflowers with a mossy bench under an arbour such a place as of all others he loved he sat down on the bench and saw that there was before him a tremendous yawning mountain gulf or valley miles deep but what lay beyond he knew not since it was all covered with a veil of rolling purple cloud of richest hue in which he saw eyes of light wander like stars then he perceived standing by his side a very beautiful woman young and lithe holding a flask ‘have i not known thee of yore o sister’ asked flaxius in etruscan ‘art thou not of the lases who receive the spirits of the departed’ ‘i am of the lases and i am alpan or alban the fairy of the dawn and their chief’ said the maiden gently ‘and i am sent by the lord of this land whom men know as pluto to welcome thee but firstbehold’ and as the music sweet beyond dreams again rose gentlyas in a play or orchestrathe lasa waved her hand and the purple cloud vanishing revealed to flaxius such a vision of stupendous and beautiful palacesall forming oneas he had never in all the splendour of the antique world seen the like of he recalled babylon memphis persepolis athens alexandria rome the temples of greece and of egypt in all their massive mystery the marvels of the buddhist structures of cambodia and india the awful grotesques of america the stately lombardnorman cathedrals of the westthe gothic glory of europeand all seemed to be poor and wretched yea squalid beside the grandeur magnitude and elaborate perfection of what was now before him ‘this must be’he said but he could speak no more so overwhelmed was he at the sight ‘yes’ added albana reading his thought ‘it ispandemoniumthe first structure ever erected’ ‘ay’ replied flaxius recovering of course to make a reflection ‘and i see that architecture has step by step sunk as man has risen another paradox and this’ he suddenly exclaimed ‘is hell’ ‘yes flaxius’ replied the fairy with a sad smile ‘and be thankful that thou comest here as an immortal who will depart as soon as thou shalt have learned the mystery for verily with thy love and knowledge of the beautiful in art it had also gone hard with thee’ ‘another paradox’ thought flaxius ‘so tout lasse tout passe tout casse en avant’ ‘and now’ said albana ‘for new sights but wait drink from this flask all who enter this realm must do so’ ‘i know it of old’ said flaxius ‘it was the draught of the mysteries given me by the fairy when i was made immortal i drink to thee’ he said ‘o terrible ruler of this wondrous world yes to thy realm and to thy mystic spouse and with them to the angel of my dreams and also thee my fair angelic guide’ as he said this there came from the depth below an ebony car or boat exquisitely inlaid with gold in richest profusion which rose slowly quivering with the music to their feet then there was a far soft sound as of melodious chimes of a thousand bells ‘enter with me’ said albana and having entered they floated slowly over the gulf they saw the city palace in new forms while far beyond a landscape of marvellous beauty also developed itself and in it too were other palaces towns towers burgs and villes or villas castles and immense ranges of crenellated arched walls with glorious gates and over the walls grew or hung masses of trees or clustering vines bright with a mystic beauty of their own they landed at the edge of an immense marble precipice which was however richly carved far adown with quaint devices the more beautiful for moss and grey lichen there appeared to be nothing freshly new yet nothing ruined in the whole land all spoke of an old time for ever young ‘you see no escort’ said albana ‘you are too great a visitor to be received with a cortège or a procession as we welcome the small great men of earth it is long indeed since any one was received with such honour as this you are deemed to be above ceremony’ ‘charming’ thought flaxius ‘the greatest mark of attention which i ever received in my life is the most devoid of all semblance of politeness another paradox but this i understand’ ‘i think beautiful albana’ he remarked ‘that your company alone is here considered the highest compliment which can be paid to a guest’ ‘his majesty the king has said so’ replied albana simply meanwhile they had been passing along streets and scenes of surpassing magnificence or beauty and after traversing a garden of the gods came to an immense open portal which they entered and so on and ever on through stupendous colonnaded corridors and cloistered squares with innumerable groups of statuary and fountains like vast rivers trained to play great as the nile when freshets fill its flood leaping on high a mile then roaring down through arches strange and high falling over thundering waterfalls broad and deep as niagara by towers like that of glorious babylon which met the clouds and above and beyond and higher yet again like stairs of mountains beyond mountains growing dim were walls of citadels like snowy marble with a coral blush in the sunset and domes like diamond and pearly spires glinting with gold in every form of grace when at last passing along a turquoisewalled and opalpaved arcade to which unbroken divans of lapis lazuli inlaid with silver seemed more beautiful for inexhaustible masses of all shades and kinds of blue flowers hanging from vines growing in vases of sapphire so that the very air seemed to be of a dreamy azure hue they came to a door and passed into a hall wherein sat not on a throne but in a thronelike ebony high chair at a table a man of godlike mien and marvellous dignity so far beyond anything human in his awful beauty was he that flaxius was more deeply impressed by him than by all the wonders which he had thus far beheld and truly as flaxius reflected when a man has passed some scores of centuries in forming ideals of the beautiful and finds his ideal outdone ’tis time to look about for new powers the olympian jove with a shade of lucifer the spirit of the serene heaven mingled with the darker yet still beautiful earth below the two united as by a spirit in the eternal yet ever intermingling ocean of the eye such he appeared and flaxius recalled goethe ‘the soul of man is like the water from heaven it cometh to heaven it riseth and thence at once it must back to earth for ever changing’ moreover there was in the wonderfully grand face something sympathetically human and humanly chevaleresque even touching in genial moods on the ‘devilish handsome fellow’ ‘i have heard’ thought flaxius ‘of a town in western america wherein appeared a married lady of such irresistible beauty that all the male inhabitants of the place even unto the deacons gave up the commandments or more especially one of them as a bad job a few like his majesty turned loose on london society would convert mayfair into a divorce court’ for he had at times a smile a laugh which went like an electric flash of champagne to the heart of your heart which is the reason why the inhabitants of a certain american state with the exquisite poetry peculiar to their refined natures call apple brandy ‘jersey lightning’ it being so potent that a taste thereof goes flashing and coruscating through the soul suggesting etna in full play on the great fourth of july day of judgment when the sæculum or fin de siècle or the age is to be dissolved in sparks since having gone up like a rocket it is to come downlike the stick this glance had pluto and flaxius found it useful because by means of it his majesty rendered clear or as one may say coloured like an artist the outlines of his spoken arguments ‘you are truly welcome flaxius’ said the lord of the underworld ‘as are all immortal mortals who have raised themselves as types of ideas to such a power that they can pass my realm as tourists between heaven and earth without becoming mine ah that is a very vulgar error on earth that i pass my time in trying to catch souls did men but know how i pass all my life in painful effort to get rid of them well i have seen here in days of yore each for his three days adonisah he stayed six months by request of my wife orpheusmusicpoor fellow socrates buddha danteyou know the listand so on down to emanuel swedenborg and every one of them saw hell after his own fashionand then raised it after his peculiar style to earth and no one interfered with the seeing thereof ‘but my flaxius’ resumed pluto with a genial smile ‘is there any reason why we should not drink although we are in hell’ ‘raison de plus most men would surely think’ replied flaxius and at the word there were before them two goblets creaming and streaming over and flaxius noticed that the infernal care of details was exquisitely carried out in this that the drops which are generally a great drawback to the overbrimming beaker did not fall on his clothes and wet or stain them but becoming diamonds or pearls rebounded dry and the draught was transcendentalso cool so piquant so enlivening pluto smiled ‘confess flaxius’ he said ‘that hell is not as you find it exactly what man imagines it to be’ ‘true’ said flaxius emptying his goblet which refilled itself ‘and yet i imagine that i am as far as ever from knowing what it is’ ‘and that distance’ replied the monarch drawing his own glass ‘i will diminish for thee o thou sage of sublime common sense for thou shalt have a nearer perception of the truth and what inferno is than any of thy predecessors’ now flaxius comfortably seated in a highbacked chair with the towering jacqueline can or goblet foaming before him listened arrectis auribus graving every word which he heard on the tablet of his soul even as alba seated on a greek tabouret at a little distance was doing on a leaf of ivory with her stylus and here notes flaxius in the margin ‘it is a curious fact that alban is depicted in etruscan vases as holding a stylus or pen and that the witches of tuscany who still know her as bellaria declare that she is the spirit of the pen and is the one to be invoked by all who would write ie compose well aurora musis amica ‘know my flaxius’ began his majesty ‘that earth and all its trials troubles and torments diseases and miseries ceases even for the worst and wickedest when they come here we begin with them all de novo on an entirely new systemthe old body is gone and we are done with it physical torment ceases with the old life for even the most earthly only ideas and earthly ideals remain and to these is given full scope and free play all begin here with unlimited freedom and indulgence’ ‘if i may interrupt your majesty’ said flaxius ‘i would remark that many people would suppose that you are by inadvertent error describing heaven’ ‘yes’ replied pluto ‘that is indeed the heaven of every fool but it is the surest way to come to grief in the long run the ultimate extreme of hell or of punishment is for every man to be left utterly to himself to have his own way to follow his own fancies to rule as he lists and do uncontrolled just what he likes few and far between have those mortals ever been who gifted with power would not damn themselves on earth if left without guidance or control ‘now this is hell and if thou wouldst know what the word really means i reply “a place where every one can do just what he pleases and have all that he wants” every one entering here is supplied with such a world as he desires with corresponding scenes and companionshe himself unconsciously drawing them all from memory and imagination but notefor it is an important pointthat they believe it all to be real and in a certain sense it is so for they have given to them the power which science will some day give to man on earth of perfect synthesis by volitionthat is of drawing out the elements by will from the prima materia or materialising unseen elements or conceptions’ ‘i understand’ said flaxius ‘gods in a small way demiurguses make things’ ‘they think so’ laughed pluto ‘all here believe for a long timeas they believed like fools on earththat all which they saw on earth or see here is real what is real is unchangeable and eternal who lives in evolution as all do on earth or in matter lives in the transient it is when they realise by mere satiety the unreality of things that their punishment comesthat of despair then after a season they begin to exert themselves to seek higher ideals or something new which being attained there comes again satiety and then renewed effort every new stage becoming easier until at last man rises to the gods or god the best experience disappointment and rebuffs but they go on the wise who on earth have shaped better ideals the altruists and benevolent philosophers or christians and people who have not meddled with others or lived entirely in the eyes and opinions of others or revelled in notoriety or been selfish and tyrannical in the small or great relations of life these do not remain long in our world of shams the honest poet or artist or man of letters is let off very easily as indeed are all who have been kinder to mankind than mankind has been unto them ‘the world is ever advancing’ continued pluto ‘and to satisfy the soul with what is for the time around it on earth or to think of carrying it on for ever into the future as all creeds do’ added his majesty significantly ‘is to stop flaxius my son be thou not like to them but keep that holy emblem the cup going’ they both drained and the lord of hades resumed ‘the selfish nature thus gratified and satisfied with temporary forms does not lift its mind to or progress withevolution’ ‘ha’ quoth flaxius ‘light is coming fast i do begin to feel i have indeed immortal longings in me this then is the faith so long foretoldwhich is neither buddhist nor christian nor material’ ‘ay flaxius it is the very truth as it seems to me every one might surmise from the very infinity of creative forms in nature from the ideals which they declare and the inexhaustibility of matter and force all goes on slowly it seems but there is eternity to work in and its great law is progress ‘now evolution is the creation of new laws from old of new types from others exhausted of new ideals as new patterns are created ad infinitum by a revolving kaleidoscope a continual outblossoming and ripening of flowers which were once small wild blossoms and are now hundredleaved grandifloræ and these again will be raised to newer and more magnificent forms and you need not ask what is to become of man in all this for rely upon it where all is progressing all is well he who is magnanimous and who can grasp in its fulness all this scheme will not be afraid to cast himself headlong into the foaming flood and trust to its bearing him safely on fortune favours the bold and he who is afraid whimpering “what is to become of poor little me” will be carried away in time all the same but that man never loved the beautiful or nature who feared death ‘now we may consider all mankind on earth as a single man in hellliving in evolution yet ignorant of it opposing it with his selfformed conservative ideasan old woman sweeping out the sea with a broomand you have the key to the whole’ ‘it appears to me’ observed flaxius who had listened to these remarks with evident approbationif the taking a drink ever and anon and sighing with content could be interpreted as ‘hear hear’ or ‘fervent applause’‘that there is a marvellous spirit of romance and poetry and wild adventure in evolution as you set it forth and exquisite inspiration to a higher devotion and a purer and far more vigorous religion than man has ever before dreamed of for this faith in nature with her everunfolding ideals and that of self in “what i know not but in the best that i know” is so bold and knightly that before it all that was ever presented to man seems poor and weak and dim the church and conventional cant or modern life have wellnigh crushed out in man every trace of daring or chivalry and this religion has in it that which will revive such qualities on a far higher scale than was found in the middle ages’ ‘saving this flaxius’ added his majesty ‘that evolution asks man to understand pure science as a basis and accept its deductions as to evolving ideals and not rely entirely on tradition which is wellnigh folklore and when the simple truth of anything has once been studied or accepted the poetry and romance soon follow crede experto roberto’ ‘ay by the father of the fathers of faith’ exclaimed flaxius ‘your majesty has had some experience may i venture to inquire’ he added ‘what part this ever “freshly fresh and newly new” as the hindus sing it this everbeautiful and good young lady whom i see here has in your tremendous pension or boardingschool for eternity’ ‘eternity’ said pluto with a smile ‘nay you have not yet heard the last word but as for albana’ here he gave a glance of ineffably respectful fond kindness at the subject of their discourse ‘you have seen in life in many lands noble women who as sisters of charity or slummersgo anywhere to do good albana ranges through hell earth and heaven the pure soul is everywhere at home and love hath no bounds we are not so cruel in our punishment as to leave souls entirely to themselves in the task of rehabilitation she and her sisterslove and love alonesuggest to the despairing new ideals of life’ ‘ay’ cried flaxius ‘hell is the gate to heaven that i see a lesson which i should have learned on earth yet man has been there longer than i without learning it it must be so“pluto thou reasonest well”’ he added and to himself ‘i suppose the reviewers will light on that as a typographical error’ ‘and now’ said his majesty ‘the lecture is over for today go with albana as a beatrice through my realm and visit the condemned in their homes’ ‘and the last word to which you alluded’ inquired flaxius ‘it is’ said pluto with a smile ‘that all which you have seen or shall see here in hades as i have indeed plainly said already is to speak sanscritically only maya or illusion all smoke but it rises from a real fire itemissa est’ ‘and what did you think of the lower world’ inquired the fairy of flaxius ‘that it is misnamed o soul of the violets’ replied the etruscan ‘since it appeared to me as being one degree higher than this for in it the average philistine and guineapig and sinful gossip are gently led or induced to find out that they are fools or evildoers and that he who gives himself most earnestly to life goes deepest into death now man is destined to slowly learn this lesson through the ages and as he progresses in it science will step by step overcome death so that as we become idealists so shall we also advance into earthly immortality that your fairyness is what i conclude from what i beheld in fact i am so smitten with admiration at the beautiful humanity of hell as i saw it that i can only declare that if there is really no such place there ought to be one’ ‘it will do just as well if you write and publish an account of it’ replied the fairy ‘the main thing is to teach mankind the great lesson that most men left to mere commonplace and earthly ideals must inevitably damn themselves’ ‘beyond this o loveliness’ resumed flaxius ‘i was induced to reflect that to avoid hell satiety and despair it is necessary to have an iron will and one formed on the strictest moral lines and he who can make a perfect will unto himself so as to make his whole soul or intellect obey his spirit or conscience or godwithin has won all that he needs in time or eternity this o life of endless light is the great lesson of orcus’ ‘it would have been well worth going there to learn that’ said the fairy ‘had it even been all fire and suffering but haste and write it down for many there be who need the lesson which is the highest of all in true wisdom ‘he to whom the devil grants all he wishes all he wants however gaily time be passed will catch the devil at the last’ flaxius and adelindè a legend of the early lombard days being one of the visions which flaxius had while in hell ‘said chider the immortal the ever young “i passed by a city a man stood near plucking fruit that in a fair garden hung i asked “how long has the city been here” he said as the clustering fruit he caught “there was always a city in this spot and so there will be till time is not” five hundred years passed by as before i was standing upon that spot once more”’ while the learned flaxius repeated these lines with strange feeling as if recalling to him missing memories he looked intently at every object round as if he would wring from it some buried mystery or longhidden secret it was twilighttide in the last goldenbrown of a carpoccio sky broad and wide in the rapidly dimming distance were undulating hills covered with vineyards and olives like a waving sea topped with green foam here and there were hamlets of white houses and above them stately towered castles like shepherds watching flocks of sheep at eve long lines of stone walls flowing with maidenhair or helmeted with cactusall softly fair and far away it was a beautiful picture but what interested the man of many years and bygone lives was what lay close about himthe grey and mossy relics of an ancient villeit may have been a quaint small town of wellmarked fortalices or a brave and beautiful little city in lombard timesnow all abandoned in its solitude here and there a run of ivied wall and a square tower still held themselves up respectably as if opposing a stout heart to bad fortunea fine thing to see in any ruin be it of man or marble there were hillocksruined archesand now it was all a home for ghosts and owls or else some shadowy nighthag wandering slow and as flaxius considered the masses of ferns and weeds and saucy acanthus and golden blossoms of many kinds and arrogant asphodels which seemed to crowd themselves into the ruins and say ‘poor things we will protect you and make everything look respectable’ the sage reflected ‘’tis all as in every citywhere la génération qui vient se moque de la noblesse qui vagolden blossoms or guineapigsflaunting weeds rotting while they cover that which is older and nobleravanti dandelionspisciacane in italianwith your flowers like golden florins and your dandylions of sons begone’ as if in answer to him he heard a bell from some church cloister far away strike twelve softly and slowly as if the chimes had been transfused through the honeygolden summer air which lingered into night and with the last note all the weeds and flowers vanished the ruins revived shooting up again into ancient glory towers rose from the dustfaçades enniching many a form of forgotten saintstransfigured and idealised and over all zigzagging and working wildly into lifelike pictured dreams innumerable arabesques of old lombard vines and monsters warriors fighting dragons whose tails ended in branching dragonwort and dogs who were half dogwood chasing wolves who were threequarters wolfsbanepuns in stone for those who can read them stern and unmoved sat the man of many ages looking at the wondrous transformation scene as if at the opera like one who has had for years a season ticket he keenly looked to see if it were well done for he was a member of the eternal press which reports history the great times of all time and verily he who has mastered the course of the circling ages in chronicles and feels their soul and has learned their lesson may sit like mephistopheles before the sphinx and put such mocking questions as he will with all the might of all that man may dare then one by one and two by two lights began to appear in the windows and a great beacon fire at first all violet and anon waving into blended emerald and scarlet flame blazed out on the summit of the donjontower and soon all the scene was translucent and fluent with a wondrous glow as if an aurora had been suddenly born or the goddess of the four winds amid blazing laurel and roses while the fairies sang a pæan of welcome as a romagna legend tells the tale for with the outbursting light there rose a strange sweet chorus of unearthly voices in the longforgotten lombardgothic tongue and flaxius hummed softly to the air ‘five hundred years have passed by as before i am listening to the song once more’ then shadowy forms were seen among the shades as if born from them and blending in them and as the light grew they too became beings of light and colour and beauty lords and ladies of the olden time with their pages and maidens dressed in the latinlombard style in which as in its sculptures a rude northern strength submitted to and was blended with romanogreek grace and ornament even as hercules was subdued by omphalé ‘five hundred years’ hummed flaxius ‘that garb once more’ in step with the music and as if moving with the waves of coloured light gracefully and stately as swans in a dream there came by a walking group of gentlemen and ladies who seeing flaxius paused while one from the latter said to him in old italian ‘mortal since thou art here sleeping at midnight and in full moontide thou hast won the power to behold us and share our festivity join us and enter the castle’ gravely and almost sadly answered the man of the ages in the old lombardgothic tongue ‘i am as little mortal as ye are immortal ye shadows of ghosts of days long passed away but what ye offer me in courtesy i do with thankful courtesy accept my lord agobard of the amal race i was by your side when you routed the romans at ravenna and when you retreated beaten yet glorious before the huns in the mark of tuscany know that your name is still to be read in old chronicles my lady chlodoviga now luisa i am glad to see that your firesapphire eyes still flash as fiercely from under your golden hair as they did when we last met’ ‘knowest thou me’ exclaimed a giantlike and ancient warrior with a vast grey beard yet who had all the fire of youth and by whom stood a younger noble who was like the elder in all save age ‘am i still remembered on earth’ ‘well do i know thee master hildebrand and not i alone but all men living where’er resounds the german tongue and german hymns to god are sung for all men who can read it have read the song of the father and the son of thee and of my lord hahdubrand now by thy side unto whom i offer greeting while the book of heroes shall live ye will live in it’ ‘and thou great master who hast the serpent tongue of gunlaug’ ‘ask me not but i am of the sorcerer race of the god frey and was ere thou wert born’ so in music and light they all gravely passed into the castle through brilliant buzzing groups harpers and hornplayers and citharœdi making musicthreading the mazes of a torchdance till my lord hildebrand led flaxius before a lady seated beneath a canopy on a double chair like a throne the canopy was of lightbrown silk from sicily and on it were heavily embroidered dragons and leafy branches in black and gold with many red and gold disks the throne was of dark nut wood and ivory she who sat on the throne was a queen of beauty of a beauty long passed away with the chivalry and romance of the early gothic time for every age as flaxius said has its own beauty which busts or portraits never portray to those who come after though they may have been perfect likenesses any more than the dried flower retains its early perfume for there was in the woman’s face a nameless stern firm will an unfamiliarity with little things and small sentiments the steady glow of a soul which knew only great aims and was used to great efforts and such were all who were leaders in those days and in each other they all read their like which is a noble thing for noble minds yet there was in her eyes a glow and glory of beauty and of passion which betrayed unearthly blood and immortal longing and as she looked with a smile of welcome at flaxius there flashed into his mind a feeling of joy which she little suspected that he was not one who could be bewitched or silenced or bullied by any magic ‘five hundred years have passed by as before i gaze upon those eyes once more’ ‘i present to your princely highness’ said lord hildebrand ‘a stranger of great wisdom whom we found within the domain who he may be lady adelindè i cannot divine but i warrant him well worthy a warm welcome’ ‘it is given with a good will’ replied adelindè in a deep sweet voice which was as marvellous and strange as her eyes and which seemed like their light changed to sound ‘and be not alarmed or astonished sir stranger to find yourself in what is doubtless to you a marvellous scene of enchantment’ ‘i am not’ answered flaxius simply as he gazed at her ‘there is nothing here so wonderful as thou art’ now be she fairy or sorceress or ghostdevil of a peeress or diabolical princess a woman is always a woman and the lady adelindè who was something of all of these at once divined that flaxius was no common mortal such as she had been accustomed to catch and cajole now and then to turn out of doors that he might find himself rip van winkled or barbarossa’d or seven sleepered and seven years older in the morning lying with a rheumatism on a cold stone the lightlyrosy snow of her fair cheeks flushed to richer red at the steady glance of the stern greyblue eyes of her grim guest in whom she at once felt a power perhaps beyond her ownchi saand it was with a tone into which she infused her very best sorcerythe kind formerly conserved for kingsthat she invited flaxius to rest himself beside her on the throne ‘you will join our banquet’ she asked with another professional smile ‘i have had nothing to eat all day’ replied flaxius in true old lombardoroman tone note that there was a great deal in this manner and tone and the princess caught it ‘for we all require food’ added flaxius ‘mortals or spirits all eat and drink’ ‘we’ reflected adelindè ‘the “mortals and spirits” was an afterthought i wonder who or what he is’ ‘even mortals’ continued flaxius ‘require scent and taste in their food else it would not nourish them mere spiritual beings live simply on taste and scent while the still more refined or divine exist on perfume alone you fairest adelindè have i doubt not very often dined on a daisy had the scent of a pink for an entrée and a sniff of a rose for dessert but that much you absolutely required there were even mortal queens of yore who were thus refined chrimhilde was one the chronicle does not mention it but it is true that when our old friend hildebrand with hero hagen ravished her rosegarden they destroyed her larder’ ‘no he is not a common mortal’ flashed adelindè through her mind for she always thought in sheetlightning ere she spoke and i pray you note that this metaphor is truthful enough for a later latin writer tells us that the voices of all unearthly beings are like thunder there being even in their softest dulcet tonessi symphonia canere vel ad tibiam versus fundereeven when they sing their sweetest in symphonies or pour forth their souls unto the witching flute a softly murmuring undertone or strange dark suspicion of the grandeur of the voice of god as it speaks in the stars and the spiritual sheetlightning of adelindè’s thought was materialised in her glances meanwhile the banquet or revel grew wild and bold flaxius ate like a mortal or like three‘decidedly he is only human’ thought adelindèand drank like four five or six but there was no change in the greyblue eyes or in his voice ‘no he is inhuman’ reflected the lady ‘mortal man could never drink like that’ yet she had seen stout drinkers in her time in the old romanlongobardi days yes they drank like bricks for as ye know a dry brick will absorb its own equivalent of fluid which the latins rendered ranas superat bibendo and the old italians ‘like a german’ or a cardinalcardinal virtues being alack more like carnal vices in those days wilder pealed the music louder laughed and roared the company from a revel which would have maddened a mortal it became a sabbath of sorcerers and witches a pandemonium of passions an inferno broken loose even the figures in the marvellous mosaics on the vaulted ceiling abovesaints and kings and queens and warriors brave such as we still see at ravennabecame animated and danced or embraced trailing after them gorgeous and jewelled robes so that as there had been over much decay and silence and death before in the ruin even so there now seemed to be as much excess of life and tumult a reverend bishop reeled and tumbled down while saints too fondly fondled saintessesa rosy winelight seemed to tinge the air as if the very hall itself were drunk and all were swimming in a ruby sea quasi vinis græcis neptunus suffudit mare the princess wild as a mænad wanton as a faun had cast herself on the heart of her guest while she seemed joyous as a mad pantherthe maddest of all things when gay5but she still realised to her unbounded awe that she in all deliria of delight had never for an instant cast a charm or fascination over her mystic guest but what was to her astounding wellnigh petrifying a thing new to her since a thousand years the princess felt a mighty thrilling influence in her heart a newborn spirit speaking in her soul that she herself was at last being won instead of being the winner but why this should have so fearfully struck and startled her not without a joyous afterglow of hope will appear anon ‘great and marvellous man’ she at length exclaimed recovering her breaththen bursting into her true self and life’twas like a pale moon exploding into a noonday sun‘tell me who or what art thou now speaking our longforgotten lombard tongue knowing all my court and me inaccessible to my power and oh that i should ever dare to think and dream it perhaps mastering me’ ‘dost thou desire it’ asked flaxius calmly ‘does the lost soul desire to be freed from hell’ cried the princess in a long wailing tone of a spirit in despair ‘does the prisoner on the rack wish the torture to cease man of mystery’ she suddenly cried ‘dost thou know my life and my doom’ ‘well do i know it’ replied flaxius ‘and now look me well in the eyes thou daughter of the old lombard line of kings and yet a spirit’s child for thy fated hour has come at last yet ere i tell thee more answer me great soul what has this life which thou didst take of thy own free choicewhen thou hadst liberty to choose among allwhat has this life become which was as thou didst once declare the only heaven thou couldst understand’ ‘it has become a hell’ replied adelindè with an immortal shudder ‘a hell of weary wornout oftrepeated imagery of splendour a tiresomeness of idle power with the real torment of the conscience that i wasa fool’ ‘he or she is a long way advanced towards freedom or wisdom’ quoth flaxius ‘who has found out that heor sheis a fool well lady thus it was that centuries ago there lived on earth a beautiful princess of the lombard line who had a sorceress mother and a fairy amalalruna ancestress and who having been trained to all the mysteries and magic of the north as well as of rome and of many races attained to such power as had rarely been given to woman yet through it all she retained beauty and the love of power and pleasure of magnificence and the keen fierce delight of preying on the hearts and lives of men and of living even as thou livest here now adelindè ‘and having gained great power and on one occasion by mighty worship and great services to tiniathe great ruling spirit of the tuscan landobtained full and free choice as to her future life for ever she said “what that life for saints may be i know not but this i know that the life which i now lead is all that heart can desire and i would fain live it so long as a single fibre of my soul remains as it is” ‘near and dear to her in those days was one who had lived in the ages and been her teacher and more and had tried to win her from her worldly wont and all in vain so they went their ways she to splendour and pageantry in life and after life and he to study and observe in existences beyond her ken and in her gaiety and luxury the ages rolled on and as they rolled there wore away the happiness of her elfin life and torment set in the torment ordained to every one on earth who succeeds in having to satiety and excess his own will’ ‘man thou speakest true’ wailed the princess as the voices of revelry sank lower and the figures fading began to pass away and the lights grew dim the music became softer in its modulations and the mind of flaxius ran insensibly into unspoken song in accompaniment with the line ‘five hundred years have passed by as before’ ‘one by one’ he resumed ‘the enchanted princess lost her passions and longings she had delirious desires keen appetites an immortal and beautiful thirst an exquisite appreciation of all that is beautiful dainty caprices delicate and true wit humour whim wildwill and attic salt were as life to her she revelled in music and song and lettersas thou dost in this life or as thou didst when in the body’ the poor princess grew tearful the marble pallor of her fading cheek might have made sorrow in the hardest heart ‘yes it all wore into triteness and commonplace even the being hungry and eating desiring and realising the same things over and over again for she had a soul and every soul is damned as soon as it is clogged and stops working like a bee that has wished itself into eternal honey’ adelindè cried on ‘but one thing survivedit generally is about the last thing to die out of any woman’s heartand that was the desire to fascinate men to win them to impose on them and to have her own way she felt it in her head and heart like a curse she knew it was the poison of her soul everything else grew stale but that kept fresh ‘and it had been decreed that if she could ever meet a man who could resist and conquer her the spell would end but alas she had wished for and won such a stupendous stock of enchanting charms that she was perfectly irresistible and simply distracting which is a thing that stands between many a woman and her salvation in all ages for it has kept more souls in the dark and made more ugly fools who might have become spiritually beautiful than any cause on earth so from such mothers many men are fools an agrippina has always a nero for a son’ crushed to naught fair adelindè wept till lifting her eyes to those of the guest a sudden tremendous convulsion one of transcendent rapture mingled with strangest amazement thrilled over her she bent on him a glance which might have split a stone the music played on ever more softly more sweetly to their words in perfect time ‘now i know thee flaxius’ she cried ‘vicisti thou hast conquered the last link of the chain which bound me for centuries to earth is broken and even in the hour in which we meet beloved master and in the instant of our love because it is our love and i am conquered i leave thee for the better life beyond but ah to have remained with thee i would have gladly endured this ghostly existence which had become a torment all this is ended now these walls will know me no more the peasant benighted will no longer see strange lights flickering over the ancient ruin the enchantment has departed and the spell of golden glory and glamour will no longer shine at midnight in these halls the wanderer may now safely sleep here he will behold no longer the elfin array or my lombard lords and ladies of the olden times nor be enchanted by their queen sound for the last time my fairy musicyour sweet strains will never more be heard in the court of adelindè farewell o master we shall meet again soon and full often in a better lifesuch as thou hast chosena life not clogged by earthly desires or petty worldly aims’ as she said this the princess cast herself in a last passionate embrace on the breast of flaxius and as she did so he felt that her life and form were passing away to a purer more idealised existence the figure faded the features the face last of all the ineffable splendour of the sorceress’s eyes in which there was the radiance of a divine parting smile she spoke no more the music died away ‘o love in thy glory go’ said flaxius ‘never yet passed into life eternal a sweeter soul never yet was a fairer goblet of the ancient time remelted into a nobler form o love in thy glory go lovelier form did never fade brighter rose was never broken ’tis but a brief minute since thou wert in thy inferno of despair and now by one instant’s flash of love and humility thy beautiful soul is passing through the goldenpearled portals and through the halls of the heavenly unknown even i cannot tell not in this short space what sphere contains the fairy soul that hath forsook her mansion in this earthly nook o love in thy glory go’ silent and alone sat flaxius as the shades vanished one by one last of all there stood before him the giant forms of hildebrand and his son hahdubrand the warrior pressed his hand and spoke no word but flaxius read in his eyes deep and full feelingthe knowledge of all that had passed and a farewell ‘yes farewell my brave old companion of ancient days’ said flaxius ‘thou too mayst pass away to lands beyond thou didst battle for glory and fame and hast learned from me that it has been truly won du kannst zu land ausreitenso warrior fare thee well’ so he sat there till all had passed away the glitter and glamour of chivalry and a fairy court till the high towers had become a low grey ruin and the spiders’ webs hung again in the palace halls and there were vines on crumbling walls and the stones themselves to ruin grown like him seemed deathlike old then as in waves the weeds grew again up to where he sat and as the rising sun cast its first ray on him he started as if from a dream ‘comedia luget scena est deserta’ he murmured ‘now if i wished to preach a new faith to mankind adelindè has given me the text for i now see that hell is the place where every mortal can have to his heart’s content his own desire as pluto declared and this hell may be on earth in life and all may know it in their very hearts ‘hæc fabula docet’ wrote flaxius on the revise ‘two or three morals not mentioned in the conclusion item the spirit that is in the trees the being in green leaves among the groves the rocks and waters or the wanton weeds reveals unto the poet wondrous things which being written are as real in truth in beauty and in goodness for the world as aught that ever happened in the past he who has mastered this in every sense lives in a fairyland while here on earth yet they are few who ever master it ‘and yet again that great prosperity gives birth to a vanity which is often an intermittent weakness in men and a steady madness in women as may be clearly discerned in the memoirs or lives of all who have flourished in the atmosphere of courts wherein as in a hothouse things worth no more than weeds in nature or in their proper state are as exotics nursed up into such condition by prosperity that they despise every flower or plant which grows in the open air for who indeed has not known some feebleminded man or woman whose head has been so turned by having everything he or she wanted that either is fain to scream as at some great inhuman injustice when a miracle is not wrought in some dire needas in the want of “diamonds like the duke’s”’ ‘now it was in the instant when her vanity was humiliated for ever and she realised that there was indeed a man who was too much for her that adelindè first saw herself in very truth as she was like hawthorne’s man of straw and grasped the tremendous truth of christian humility which is enough time for a great mind to be saved just as one handful of powder will in an instant overthrow a lordly tower while it may require a ton thereof and a long time to destroy a mudbank ‘but every mortal be he who he may has learned a great lesson and taken his first step to divinity when he has learned in very truth that he is not a god ‘finally there are many who imagine that old age cannot attack a man while he has health strength and physical or worldly appetite and so long as he is a brute or a fool were it for a thousand years he could indeed go on eating drinking and frolicking with his kind but with experience there comes a soul and to that soul in time a weariness of all that earth contains be it what it may now it is a curious thing to observe that as the average growth of intellect in england has increasedi pray ye here put on your studyingcapsthe average of life and the duration of vitality and intelligence has increased with it when the great duke of marlborough pleaded extreme old age in asking for merciful indulgencehe was then sixtythreeno one thought it strange ’tis hardly worth the while to say that now few people would lend grace to such a plea for life is lengthening and ‘twill lengthen on slowlyit may besurely into wondrous time 5 the frolicsomeness of a panther suggests intoxication in this it surpasses all other animals therefore the car of bacchus is drawn by panthers flaxius and the werewolf the wonderful story telling how randolph of upsala ate the sheep and how mr randolph of wall street devoured the lambs ‘now there are some people who think that those who believe they are werewolves only suffer from what is called by doctors lycanthropia but others hold that they are indeed changed to brutes and this cannot be denied and those who deny it are all infamous liars’peter goldschmied hexen advocat 1705 it happened once in the days of swordsongs and sagas runic sorcery and seadragons that flaxius found himself in sweden on a summer eve gazing at the town of upsala he sat upon the little hill before it where as tradition tells odin was buried ye may see his bones today in a pasteboard box in a case in the stockholm museum where i who write these lines was allowed to reverently touch them which is indeed a favour only accorded to a pious few who still worship the gods disguised as folklorists and archæologistsquorum pars sum now as flaxius looked upon the strange city and the old tower with its eight arches typifying the eight rings or armlets of the allfather he observed here and there on the walls swinging in the wind the corpses of the strangers who were caught straying about the country and were then sentenced to sus per coll or be hanged slung up or hitched to swing dangle swaggle and go bibbetybob in the breezes as a sacrifice to odin ‘a somewhat severe custom’ mused flaxius gently ‘yet doubtless not without its peculiar advantages the stranger within our gates often seems to us well worthy of being gated when he gets the entire government of cities into his hands and runs the taxesinto his own pocket as i with eye prophetic do foresee will be the case one day in western lands but late discovered by these valiant norse ‘but for the sacrificed on yonder walls i remember how upon a time in rome when nero made full oft grim martyrdoms that a disciple of paulus askedhearing me declare that there was humour in all thingsif it could be found in the awful conception of a god dying as a criminal to show his humility and love for the world and i can recall how odin once coming as stranger or in some disguise into this very town he being their god was seized at once and hung on yonder wall as a due sacrifice unto himself over which thing he merrily exults as if it were a wondrous racy joke as we may read in the edda ‘“for nine nights i hung on the windrocked tree a sacrifice unto myself” ‘truly the idea was too much for me but not for the allfather of the northern gods who found a grotesque humour in the conception of a creator baffled by his own work so he carried out the jest by being hung ah well he lost the game after all which shows that the scandinavians were not good mythmakers we managed these things much better in etruria greece and rome “there’s nothing sacred to a pioneer” says a french proverb and odin was the sapeur and leader and discoverer for all the north the norseman and norman were his children od or hud was his name as “the traveller” and henry hudson was of the blood like an old traveller odin would have his joke ‘but as to this custom of stringing up or scragging strangers and making them dance upon nothing in honour of the lord odin it behoves me to look to myself with care unless i too would wear a tight cravat and i care not for such worldly vanities’ saying this he wandered on and away till he came to a lonely place amid rocks and trees by a headlong stream where he paused suddenly his attention was caught by a cry which he found came from a pit hard by it was a deep and powerful voice and to it flaxius replied ‘who calls’ the voice answered ‘i am one who has fallen into this pit and have not the power to come forth’ then he sang in staffrhyme ‘“to catch the bandolf to take the adelolf bertolf eginolf frekulf aistolf hedenolf ingolf kelolf and kunolf orkulf ordulf ludolf and rachulf ralf and ranulf wolfram and tackolf theodolf unolf wolfart and many a wolf men with the sword bearers of lances go forth to battle to catch the werewolf they dig the pitfall with runes and sorcery witchrhyme and magic so well they guard it that the wild wolfman falling into it there must remain starving a prisoner until a sorcerer pitying comes to him breaking the witchspell”’ ‘which means in prose’ said flaxius ‘that a poor devil of a sheepstealer alias a werewolf is here in the pitmore’s the pity there is to my mind indeedi know not whysomething less of crime in stealing mutton and venison than some other things in fact i remember that a great etruscan dramatist now forgotten once made deerpoaching almost sacred and i recall how a bold brave man said to a judge in my hearing “jedge i’m glad you punished that mizzable creeter so severely for stealing hens being naterally strong in the back it hes befel at times when the country was thinly settled that i myself have now and then inadvertently stolen a sheep but i allays had the moral grandeur to refrain from hens hens o the low poor ornery mediumminded cusshe orter to be ashamed of himself”’ the man in the pit uttered an exclamation not overpious ‘it would serve these swedes right for their hanging strangers at upsala’ pursued flaxius ‘if i were to pull this poor devil up into the light of day let us see how they have laid their hocuspocus of runes and witchknots why rubbish and trash’ he exclaimed with a scornful laugh ‘an old roman witch who tells fortunes for a penny would undo this sorcery with a pin ahem let me try ‘aldebarantiphoscophornio bombochidescluninstaridé sarchides tarchun hinthial tara therethe charm is broken werewolf my son come forth’ and sure enough the pittite came forth his appearance was not to draw it mildly as flaxius observed unto himself ‘absolutely prepossessing’ punchius a celebrated roman jester of the lower empire once remarked of such an appearance ‘that he would not be a nice customer to meet of a dark night in a lonely lane on the loose’ for he was red all over as if with excessive health and awful in muscle an overdone hercules like to the cacus of baccio or bandinell in the signoria of florence his arms hung out from his sides like a turtle’s fins because the bulging biceps were so great his hair was red and dishevelled and his eyes glared from under it with unmitigated ferocity like those of a wild cat staring from a pigpen he bore on his left arm a wolf’s skin but suddenly ere flaxius could speak a word the two found themselves surrounded by a crowd of furious rustics who had evidently been ambushed on the watch in the forest about the pit they rushed upon the pair with angry cries accusing flaxius of having delivered the werewolf also of being a stranger and ere they were aware cast over them a net in which they were helpless ‘flagrante delicto’ thought flaxius ‘misplaced humanity oft leads to woe he who lets a rat out of a trap loses his cheese what next’ the next was that the culprits found themselves imprisoned in the witchtower its walls were about twentyfive feet in thickness there was just room in it for two to sit on a bench and there was one grated window to admit air they looked at one another flaxius began to sing a song written some time after by the trouvère marie de france ‘“when lays abound ’twould ill beseem bisclaveret were not a theme such is the name by bretons sung and garwal in the norman tongue”’ ‘garwal’ exclaimed the other prisoner ‘that means mea werewolf ’tis not our tongue and yet i know the word’ ‘so i suppose my son therefore i sang’ rejoined flaxius ‘so now while we are resting a space from our romantic adventure ere we get out of this somewhat limited apartment i pray you tell me all your story clearly in simple words and few’ ‘by fenris’ exclaimed the werewolf ‘i will tell you the truth loki and hela take me if i lie i was a free simple bonde a plain small farmer and i lived from a flock of sheep it was my all and hard was my life withal now i had a rich neighbour and one year my pasture was ruined by flood and storm and this man being crafty and i as simple as a child he persuaded me to pasture my sheep on his farm for half the lambs to come but he so managed by headcraft and lawcraft as to take from me all i had and when i followed my claim at the thing or court it went even worse with me and i was cast into debt and made a thrall or slave ‘then i was mad with rage short words masteri met a witch who gave me a spell and i made myself a werewolf then i slew all that man’s sheep one by one i set fire to his homehis family all perished in the flamehe escaped lame and a beggar and i was made a wolf’s head’ ‘truly a pretty tale’ remarked flaxius ‘apuleius might have made something of it entre chien et loup in this twilight my sonor entre noushast thou more to narrate’ ‘yes i had taken from my foe’s house a goodly treasure of gold rings and coin which i have concealed now if any sorcerer would take the wolfspell from me and change my face i would buy me a ship and go apirating as a viking and so reform and lead an honest life’ ‘truly men’s ideas as to honesty’ reflected flaxius ‘are indeed somewhat involvedor as we may sayconventional but what dost thou think my son’ he said aloud ‘as to our present prospects’ ‘simply my lord that we shall be burned alive tomorrow in honour of odin’ ‘all lostexcept honour’ quoth flaxius ‘but my son i have no fancy to figure as a rôti albeit i propose to be a pièce de résistance let us for once in our harmless and innocent lives vary the monotony of moral goodness by evading the law all novelty is pleasing’ ‘and how shall we do it’ asked the man amazed ‘thou art a strong carl’ replied flaxius ‘and i warrant me that thou couldst tear yon window grating out of its place and i’tis a mere trick my soncan increase thy strength tenfold only drink now and then from this flask so so bully boy to work work while i sing to thee a magic spell taught by the great irving ‘“hinculus dinculus trinculus holy boly bum the latin for chain is vinculus nunc inspiratus sum”’ it was with intense awe that the werewolf listened to these words and in full faith that he attacked the grating which he pulled away as if it were straw ‘now try a stone my son’ exclaimed flaxius ‘naytake a pull first from the flask there is a spirit therein unknown to theespiritus vini gallici duæ unciæ fiat potatio’ crash came a stone weighing a ton then another then a third the berserker rage was on the giant soon he had made a hole through which one could have driven a coach but he kept on ‘softly softly my dear boy’ interposed flaxius ‘thou art too good an actor and wilt bring down the whole house about our ears now if thou art ready i see the new moon rising o’er yon trees ha hesperus i give thee greeting fond come to the green wood let us haste away’ it was a drop of twenty feet from the window but the red man took it like a mountain goat and then caught flaxius in his arms like a ball albeit the latter was none of your lightweights neither was he small now as the wolf was still berserkwode or halfmad with the tremendous magic potion he gave a fearful yell turning townwards ‘and shook his gauntlet at the towers’ when catching up flaxius on his back he ran with him ‘as a fox might run with a goose’ thought the passenger at headlong speed along the road and into the woods crashing through boughs and thickets over rocks leaping through torrents splashing adown a force or waterfall here up a hill there while flaxius sang ‘“va petit postillon va en avant vite vite tu vas comme l’aquilon sur ta jument favorite go on my postillion before thee lies the way and thou art like an eagle fleet upon thy gallant grey”’ truly the similes were all a little mixed but they were in a devil of a shaking jumbling hurry and there was no pause till they found themselves far away in a lonely land where it seemed as if the cock never crew the sun never shone and the wind never blew there the berserker threw himself matt and flat on the ground out of wind and dead broke and then flaxius noticed that he had in his right hand a sheep which he had caught up on the way as he ran ‘truly there is a good soldier lost in this man’ said flaxius ‘he can forage even during a retreat’ so there was resting cooking and camping au clair de la lune and the next day they went on and so to the north for many days more the wolfman seemed to be bound for a certain place and flaxius followed to see what would come thereout when on a time as they sat in a sunset on a headland overlooking a fiord and far away from upsala the wolfman said ‘master wilt thou take from me the spell which forces me when the moon is full to don this skin and raven as a wolf for anon i shall begin to feel fierce convulsions throbbing and wild commotion in all my blood and raging madness for murder in my whole soul the time for it being nearly come and then i spare neither beast nor human being now if thou dost not care to work the charm there lives near this place adown in yonder dale a finn who is a famed sorcerer and to him will i go for relief’ flaxius replied musingly more to himself than to his follower ‘yes it is true long long ago in greece i made research into the lycanthropia which is one of the oldest mysteries of mad humanity and it was in happy sunny arcadyet in arcadia egowhere all was like a proverb of sweet peace that it first showed itself to the world ‘in that land my son was a wicked king named lycaon once it happened that the great god who was as the odin and frey of your faith in one whose name was zeus or jupiter and in etruscan tinia came in disguise to this lycaon who to test the divinity or magic of his visitor set before him human flesh cooked as mutton’ ‘but that was a great sin’ exclaimed the wolfman who was listening with round eyes and full belief ‘to treat a guest who should be sacred to the vilest of the vile in such wise was nidering’ ‘it was très lowflung my son’ said flaxius who had a habit of prophetically borrowing phrases from vocabularies of the future ‘yes niederträchtig scandalous ribald scrubby pitiful vile infamous conductinfra dignitatem regis and it was promptly punished for zeus on the spot turned the king and his sons who had had a hand in the little game all into wolvesthe first wolves ever seenand they ran howling away through the door into the darkness like mad’ ‘’tis a fine tale’ said the wolfman ‘and so the first of us was a king and if he was wicked he was bold to dare such a deed’ ‘but whence came this mania’ continued flaxius talking to himself ‘since there is a scientific cause for all things h’mh’m the arcadians were of the primæval race of the pelasgi who dwelt secluded from the mob of asiatics egyptians levantines and god knows what all who fused into greeks in time in lonely valleys deep in mountain dales they pastured flocks fought with the beasts of prey and kept unchanged a mass of the wildest tales of sorcery and witchcraft in freshest faith so they knew fear in its strangest formthe panicus terrorwhich seizes on mobs of men or beasts and the deliria of spectres as no other greeks knew them out of such fear grew the bewildering insania zoanthropica and the awful insania metamorphosis of which nebuchadnezzar was the prototype finally we get to the dementia lycanthropia so interestingly exemplified in theeo my son’ he exclaimed turning to the other who had sat openmouthed with wonder and admiration at the speech of which he had not understood one word ‘by the way what is thy name my son’ he continued ‘ranulf the mad wolf is what men call me’ said the other proudly ‘mon fils ce n’est pas l’instant pour la vanité humaine’ rejoined flaxius mildly ‘but as regards removing this disorder of thine i would fain see how thy finn will work it i promise thee a cure in any case’ they went down and on till they came to a large low cottage buried amid birchtrees and willows at the door sat an old man weaving baskets droning to himself an ancient lay while by him crouched an immense cat of some wild kind the finn was dressed in furs and woven bast or softened willow wood in strips his face was withered but his eye was keen as an eagle’s and as his glance met flaxius the two understood one another ‘the curse of ilmarin or of fenris lies heavily on him’ said the finn indicating ranulf ‘he hath a double curse’ replied flaxius ‘with him it is at leysa or laedingi eda at drepa or dromathe wolf hath two fetters to breakfor he is firstly mad and secondly outlawed so that he must be mentally cured and then disguised so as to escape the law and i would fain see my brother how thou workest thy spell’ ‘by the great oak’ exclaimed the sorcerer with a shrewd twinkle of his eye ‘i doubt not that our methods are much alike but if it please you o wise lord from the far outgard to see my simple work i will most willingly do my best’ saying this he took them into a room which was closed and windowless but in which burned a large rude lapland lamp and having made ranulf drink of a certain potion he rubbed him over with an ointment in the smell of which flaxius detected certain ingredients which were to him far from being unknown ‘ahem’ he reflected ‘extract of mandragora opium henbane order solanaceæ sulphur bitumen verbena amico mio dove diavolo avete pigliato tutte queste coglioneriewhere the devil didst rake up all this stuff yea from the very ends of the earth do these voodoos and conjurors correspond and the shaman of kamtschatka sends the ammanita muscaria unto timbuctoo for sorceries proceed o friend i pray thee with thy work’ the finn laid the patient on a bed lighted a pan in which were strange fumigants and bade the werewolf look him long and steadily in the eyes which he did with ten owlpower till he began to blink like a judge after luncheon and finally went into a deep sleep then the shaman taking a kind of large ovalshaped tambourine covered with reindeer skin on which were drawn many mysterious rude figures began to beat it gently while he sang in strange and evidently carefully measured and elaborately trained tones the following ‘by the soul of him the father by the mighty wainamoinen by the sun and moon and planets and their light upon the water and the water all surrounding and the forest by the seashore and the bear within the forest and the runic mystery written on his paw and by the letters which the lightning writes in darkness only read by ilmarinen by the one three five and seven and the four which causes growing ever giving lifebegetting wolf i charge thee leave this mortal fly along the running river fly across the ferny mountains fly into the pinetree forest flee across the birchedged meadows hasten to the oakbound valley or where slopes are dense with beeches wade in haste through shallow water where the fishes dart in terror by the rock on which the warriors cut of yore their strongest record with the mesh of interlaces which avert the witches’ glances wolf i charge thee leave this mortal leave him so that when awaking he shall never more remember that he ever wore the wolf hide’ thereupon was heard near by the sound of a wolf howling and as one would think praying and expostulating with the shaman who was however very firm and when the wolf was over bold began to sing again ‘fly along the running river’ till at last the wolf was heard at some distance and then still further away his voice ever less audible until it seem to disappear amid rustling leaves and mingle with the wind ‘admirably played my brother’ exclaimed flaxius ‘apollo never did the trick better hypnotized to perfection and curedlike a ham yes the wolf will be no longer at his door and my dear doctor i like your mise en scène your drum and your poetry and perfumery by the way i can give you a hint or two as to improving the narcotics in your ointment and yet who knows perhaps for your rough folk you have the best fiat lotio cras mane sumendus’ ‘and if ranulf would like to go aviking’ said the shaman ‘there is a rich man hard by who has a fine ship to sell cheap with forty men all armed and well’ ‘just like your provident kindness’ responded flaxius ‘always the same thoughtful old chap and now for your feeyou won’t take itah yes inter doctores among us members of the faculty of course but permit me’ he said producing from his pocket a second flask of the mystic alchemical spagirical essence ‘to present to you a medicine which is as yet unknown in the north taste it and try its virtue on yourself jameson dublin’ saying this he uncorked the bottle presented it and the finnic sorcerer as the saying is ‘took a sight’ that is to say the bottle ascended at an angle of fortyfive degrees from his mouth so that his vision glanced exactly in a line with the side as if it were a pistol he took very deliberate aim was in no hurry being evidently determined to make a lineshot hit the bull’s eye and bring down the game and then clucked the shot had been fired then turning to flaxius he spoke no word but uttered a wink and such a wink as flaxius had never seen before in all his mighty experience the charge had gone home and he had brought down his racoon killing him dead at a shot6 there was a finnish shaman sorcerer who had a wondrous interview with hibernian spirits all that night and who was found next morning buried in a magic trance and far out at sea there was a solitary viking sail bearing southward and from the oarsmen came the chorus of a song in icelandic ‘sing hey sing ho for the land of flowers’ ages had come and gone and the cobwebs and dust had gathered three inches deep in crust on many an old bottle of wine in many an ancient cellar when flaxius found himself of a bright crisp autumn day in the city of new york presenting a letter of introduction to a retired stockbroker whose home was situated up the river in the catskills this gentleman was named randolph and flaxius was much pleased with him he was a genial jovial merrygotumble man in a general way with a quaint american mot for every circumstance and quick at filling the kettle whenever there was any fun to be boiled but he had withal evidently a tremendous hard pan or substratum of what is called horsesense which is a sixth sense supplied by nature to her western children he was immensely powerful in fact a perfect picture of excessive ruddy health being one of those enviable muscular beasts who can bend a horseshoe or tear in two a pack of cards and he had a tremendous shock of red hair this ‘powerful party’ took a great liking in turn to flaxius forcing him to come at once ‘to stay his time and plenty of it’ at his villa on the hudson where what between reedbird venison soft shell crab terrapin and snapper soup spanish mackerel and bluefish banquets pretty faces festivities drives and gaieties the guest drew comparisons with the pleasures of ancient rome and paris not in all respects favourable to the latter it is an invariable rule in life that however powerful and reticent a nature like that of randolph’s may be it inevitably runs into intimate confidence when it meets with another of the kind of flaxius mercury does not melt more surely into lead than the strong animal soul combines with a stronger intellectual power and the end of it was to abridge the tale that one day mr randolph told to his guest the story of his life ‘i was the son’ he said ‘of a farmer who lived in one of the eastern counties of massachusetts and who being favoured by fortune accumulated about one hundred thousand dollars i was an only son was sent to harvard graduated and went to practise law in new york ‘now with all these advantages and some plain hardworking common sense to boot i still fell into the teeth and claws of a rascal all that i can say in my own defence was that he took in and ruined many a far shrewder and more experienced man than i was he was eminently pious having what we here call ‘new jersey piety’ the kind which forms a part of everyday life even as the skin does of the body it is never laid aside even by the thief in prison or by the keeper of the lowest den of iniquity as was shown in the case of the wickedest man in new york who was withal perfectly sincere in his piety and neither a pharisee nor a hypocrite ‘this man was a stockbroker and he induced me by a series of marvellously ingenious tricks and devices to intrust to him the whole of my property he was one of those great ‘operators’ who are technically said to live by slaughtering sheep or lambs’ ‘ahem’ interrupted flaxius ‘you said lambs i think so he got all your flock’ ‘every handful of wool and left me as bare as the back of your hand it was by a very simple swindle he invested my money or that of others in stocks which were manipulated or depreciated by tricks to far below their value if a man is a thorough rascal it is easy in the immense range of insecurities to find something which can be thus run down or up so my broker when they were down bought them in for himselfit did not take him long to use up my hundred thousand when all was gone one of his clerks told me the whole story ‘i calmly and deliberately determined that i would devote my life and all its energies without one qualm of conscience to revenge i swore i would hunt him as a wolf’ ‘ah i beg your pardon’ exclaimed flaxius ‘but this is becoming extremely interesting’ ‘as a wolf hunts a deer so i went into wall street and worked as few have ever done to learn all its tricks and devices and i had a great advantage for while others worked for money i only sought to learn how to work ‘well it came to pass in time that i knew that my enemy had invested a very large part of his means in a certain manufactory which was in a remote district several days away from new york with which it had only a partial railroad communication i managed long and well till i contrived to have it telegraphed that the entire town had been utterly destroyed by fire and then we cut the telegraph wire and tore up the rail for three days we had that stock down to nothing and bought it right and left’ ‘the wolf was loose’ remarked flaxius ‘you bet and the best of it was that we ran it all over town that mine enemy had got up the whole thing himself to bear the stock so be sure he was teetotally ruined but then he had miscalculated’ mr randolph uttered this with an expression which was distinctly lupine showing his teeth in a style which recalled to flaxius an ancient witchtower in upsala and corpses hanging on the walls in the evening sunlight and a story about certain sheep and lambs et cetera ‘yes it was a glorious a noble operation’ continued mr randolph ‘and perfectly successful i got my hundred thousand back again with interest every plunker of it “plunker” is cambridge college for a dollar’ ‘palanco’ interpolated flaxius ‘the florentine for a two soldi piece the same size’ ‘and that was only the beginning of my luck’ continued mr randolph ‘for of course the truth oozed out and it gave me a magnificent reputation in wall street’ ‘truly enviable’ remarked flaxius ‘were there many think you among yourcolleagueswho would have done the same’ ‘no’ replied randolph proudly ‘not a beggar of them they hadn’t the nerve for it’ ‘it seems to me’ reflected flaxius ‘that the ideas of mankind as to honesty are somewhat conventional où diable va l’orgueil se nicher’ a few days after mr randolph invited flaxius to take a sail in his yacht and as they went along before the breeze the host said ‘i don’t know why it is but the being on board my craft and hearing the waves makes me feel as if i were an old norse vikingir strange isn’t it by the way my family was of swedish origin and yet the name randolph is virginian’ ‘h’m’ replied flaxius ‘ranolf is norse enough it means a raging wolf’ ‘hæc fabula docet’ wrote flaxius on the blank end of the revise ‘this fable teaches that life is very much the same old dish over again the solid beef or game of the dinner in the olden time recooked a little and laid lightly on toast for a more refined modern breakfast and whether it was thou and i indeed or the elements and forces which make us this much is certain that somehow and somewhere we ever were and as something ever shall be still acting this is as much of immortality as a wise man requires and a deal more than most of us deserve let us pass on to another story’ 6 mr a savage landor in his very interesting book of travels among the ainus makes mention of the marvellous power of expressive winking with which these northern savages are gifted and i have observed the same among red indians they learn it from their powwows or shamans flaxius and breitmann ‘it is told in ancient story how to the flemish court there came a knightly minstrel who made them royal sport that was as brave a recké as ever yet was seen at fighting or at singing he won the prize i ween so stately in the festal hall he caught each lady’s eye and when it came to revelling he drank the cellar dry’ while swimming onwards down the stream of time it chanced all in the merry golden hours of spring when rivulets dance and birds are on the wing ‘and a starry silver glory is at daybreak over all when the dews like gems in story on the queen like blossoms fall’ that flaxius when in innspruck sat one afternoon in a shady beergarden by the rushing river listening to two nightingales in a cage which were singing duets or holding talk in nightingale tongue with two wild ones outside the latter were complaining bitterly of the hard time they had of it to pick up a living while the imprisoned ones bewailed that their engagements to sing to select audiences did not allow them the least liberty though they lived in luxury being taken in whenever it rained and fed on ants’ eggs ad libitum which are the same to nightingales as whitby oysters caviare and pâté aux truffes are to us flaxius observed that a broadshouldered bigbearded tall and knightly man who seemed to be half soldier and as much minstrel sitting at the next table also listened to the birdsongs with a smile as if he partly understood them on a closer examination flaxius recognised in him the ritter hans breitmann whom he had met in earlier timesthe same breitmann having in a small and very quiet way a humble little sixpenny immortality just as the odd fish in nature have been preserved from the earliest types while better kinds which shone more brightly in their day have vanished the sage bowed to the minstrel the breitmann waved his beermug to flaxius and the two drank politely one to the other and to old times ‘you seem to understand birdlanguage’ remarked the other ‘nun yoost a liddle’ replied the bard who spoke all tongues in a curious patois ‘enough to get hints or dips for songs all poets know someding of it most of dem a crate deal petter as i yoost so de gypsy zigeuners play birdsongsde whole orchestranefer twice alike ach ja alles sehr schön peaudiful’ ‘could you sing me a song learned from the nightingales’ asked flaxius ‘cerdainly’ replied breitmann ‘mit bleasure’ and draining off his beer he unslung the lute from his back tuned two chords hemmed and then sang of long long ago ‘when de nightingale was singing all in de cool of eve to de pleasant breeze and de birds were flingin’ perfume from de trees hei da ri dé hei da ri do i sat by my love so fair and gay as we had sat for many a day and ach wir warn so frô lovingas dere we lay dame nightingale de wood bird small sang to us a melody how love outliveth all whate’er on earth may pe hei da ri dé hei da ri do “love passeth all both great and small so now sing afder me” we sang old songs togedder songs of de merry time and light ash any fedder we maked full many a rhyme hei da ri dé hei da ri da he da ri da laun unto a lute we sang dis lay and so we passed de livelong day until de sun went down we sang old songs togedder of loves long passed away all in de pleasant wedder ash in de grass we lay hei da ri da hei da ri dá no more can i rememper yet what i recall i’ll ne’er forget so long as life is gay’ and as the breitmann sang and tinkled his lute the nightingales who were present joined in’twas like jenny lind and parepa rosa in a duet i mention this because in a later age the souls of the two caged nightingales did actually reappear in human form as j l and p r even as vultures whom i could mention have reappeared on the stock exchange and blackbeetles as clergymen about town and butterflies as professional beauties and divers ducks as doctors and an old owl as premier but to return as they sat there at twilight tide talking over old times when they had met at the court of brave king roosevelt in holland there came the sound of a faroff bell ringing vespers and flaxius said ‘ever since the earliest times men have believed that there was a holy influence in the sound of a bell the old etruscans and their children the romans made them of bronze and sometimes of silver all to keep away witches and evil spirits in fact from the immense number which are found it would seem as if there had been at least one to every human being ‘and dot was kept up py de christians’ added breitmann ‘who peliefed a great deal still more in dem and to dis tay it is said dot witches are afraid of bells witch is de reason de priests keep a ringing dem all the while as you see py de woonderful story of der bell of kaltern here in tyrol’ ‘tell it’ replied flaxius ‘i can sing it if you would care to hear it’ answered herr breitmann ‘dot comes easier to me’ ‘all the better’ quoth the sage and breitmann chanted the bell of kaltern ‘oh the church bells at even how sweetly they ring like angels in heaven they murmur and sing where music can travel their echoes are found and naught that is evil can list to the sound so softly so quaintly they chime in their play so gently so faintly then dying away fading out with the day now no witch can hold out where the church glocke hang for the bells being blest they’re afraid of the clang at the very first sound when ’tis heard they are lost and shrivel like roses when touched by a frost and the devil himself would be off on the wing when the great bell of kaltern began with its ring ha that “busted up” as a terror to see in grand scatteration the whole company and good christians like us aren’t more frightened of hell than the witches were scared by the sound of that bell until at the last when their patience was past and the very endthread of the skein being spun they swore there must certainly something be done and something they did too at once in the cause and you soon will surmise what the handiwork was there’s a widow in eppan with glance like a dart a terrible weapon which strikes every heart with the softest of laughter the sweetest of smiles lord knows what comes after when once she beguiles and this lady of eppan is charmingly dressed she feeds upon capon with wine of the best though whence she derived all her food and the clothes or how she got these things or came to have those is what she did never to any disclose which kept people talking as all may suppose either “over the pumpkin”7 or “under the rose” now when people before them have always a curtain there’s something behind it not right that is certain and all were assured that this beautiful widow hung out what the french call a very large rideau in german gardine a kind of a pun since in dialect girl and a curtain are one but hermann von valk a chivalric young blade who was not of talk or of scandal afraid was all the more taken enchanted and shaken enraptured and mashed bèglamoured and smashed by the beautiful eyes and the wonderful mystery that seemed to envelop this lamia’s history and one day when in sport the fair widow would task him he swore he would do anything she might ask him he cared not a straw if ’twere that or were this if she only would give him one rapturous kiss with the winsomest smile that would fetch you a mile and a soft in her voice that would give you no choice but to do as she wanted “my dearest” said she “i can only ask something chivalric of thee such as noble young gentlemen ever perform when their hearts and their heads are courageous and warm and that which i want you can easily grant it isn’t a matter of shall i or shan’t in fact ’tis as easy as jumping a hurdle just climb a churchsteeple while bearing this girdle the steeple of kalternyou know it full well and bindingyou shall turn this belt round the bell bind it and wind it when you have twined it when this is done and my love is returnéd he may kiss if he like to the end of eternity” now as you may have guessed this young hermann von valk was nottruly confessed a man easy to balk so as soon as the widow her yarn had spun he jumped to his feet and cried eagerlydone “for such a reward i here swear by my soul i’d belt all the bells in the land of tyrol give me the girdle i’ll tell you what i’ll return this evening”and off he shot now though this hermann had no scrupulosity yet as a german he’d great curiosity which thing is the mother of all suspicion so he turned it all over with great precision and he said to himself “i wish i could tell what it is that she means by abelting the bell it’s very mysterioushemlet me see suppose i first try it a bit on a tree there is nothing at all in the way to prevent such a little and harmless experiment” so halfunthinking and half in joke he bound the girdle about an oak it was a grand tremendous tree as vast as man did ever see standing alone so grave and solemn with trunk as tall as the highest column but scarce that girdle was brought around and scarce the belt on the bark was bound when a crash like a thousand thunders came and before his eyes all swam in flame as if hell had broke loose in very fact and from top to bottom the oaktree cracked and the fragments flew afar and wide while hermann von valk lay stunned aside the bells in time had rung several tenses before the young gentleman came to his senses and when he got there“my life” said he “i am glad that i tried that belt on a tree for if i had bound it round the bell which the witches all fear like poison and hell” when having said this he suddenly stopped as if an idea on his senses had dropped and he roared “donnerwetter mit hagel und pitch now may i be shot but the widow’s a witch es leuchtet mir ein i behold it clear as i see yon moon in her silver sphere that was a nice little task the “widder” gave me to do now i come to consider suppose instead of a tree i had placed that elegant article round my waist that were a beautiful change of scene the devil take herwhere would i have been so sure as bohemians drink slivovitz burst to pieces and blown to bits so now i will go to my home alone beautiful madamewith you i’ve done i can stand a great deal” he said with a sigh “but not the deviland so goodbye” by this adventure you plainly see that two of a trade can never agree what one had tolled the other can’t tell and a belle if a witch is afraid of a bell’ ‘well sung herr breitmann’ exclaimed flaxius ‘and the tones were as sweet as the story is strange’ ‘vot do you really dink of it’ inquired the singer with some interest ‘can it pe true’ ‘h’m very likely you must know friend breitmann that from much strange but little thought of proof i believe that from the etruscan and roman priesthood the witches and wizards of a later time inherited much knowledge and many strange secrets regarding electricity and this granted we can explain many of the most remarkable miracles attributed to them now admitting that they were up to producing a spark by a small charge and making an explosive the widow’s belt becomes intelligible in fact a few ounces of dynamite’ ‘vould pe a mighty crate power when a woman wanted to plow a man oop’ laughed the minstrel ‘and denn dere was poison vitch dey understanded petter still as is set fort in a pallad of de town of munich’ ‘i would like to hear it’ replied flaxius ‘we would like to hear it’ sopranoed the nightingales ‘i would like to hear it’ chirped a sparrow on the wall in contralto ‘and we also’ cooed the baritone spirits of the evening breeze as they stole through the dense foliage rustling overhead the breitmann tuned his lute and sang the ballad of narr hans’l8 ‘oh munich is a merry town ’tis writ by many a pen and all its city counsellors are wondrous merry men and when they meet for banqueting to revel or to sing from the rathshaus to the frauenkirch you hear the music ring and every master hath a squire that on his lord must wait to fill his goblet up with wine or change or fill his plate and it always was expected like the chorus to a song he must laugh at all his master’s jokes and help the fun along now one of these attendants was an odd fantastic wight you could see it in his features that something wasn’t right an anxious solemn countenance with sorrow interwrought like one who knows that he is mad and trembles at the thought and if cruel people vexed him when his heart was stirred with drink he would rave and cry the maddest things that any one could think and scream and weep and beg them all for mercy in his pain which made them roar with laughter and begin to tease again they called him the narr hans’l that is jack lunatic and all the lords resolved one day to play this man a trick so they made him eat a herring till he almost died with thirst and then gave him wine to quench it but that was not the worst for the wine had all been mingled with pepper for a trick and a subtle drug or medicine which made him sadly sick so that he ran about in pain with many a mad grimace it made the noble gentlemen all roar to see his face well well the fun was over and the jest was half forgot when again there was a banquet in that ever merry spot and since narr hans’l made such sport for every guestto dine they chose him for the kellner or master of the wine the music pealed so merrily there all was saus und braus till the chairman gave the word “schenk’ein” and then the sign “trink aus” and this was at the ending when every gentleman must drink the supernaculumdrain to the last his can to a drop upon the thumbnail nor leave behind a “rest” and the wine for this last drinking was of the very best every cupful cost a florinof that there was no doubt it glowed like golden sunlight when hans’l poured it out ha what can be the matter with the noble president that he looks as pale as ashes and extremely discontent and now he’s falling backwards in deadly agony and nowo lord the others are all as ill as he ha what can be the matter with narr hans’l through it all he is laughing he is screaming he is dancing in the hall he is changed into a devilhe gave a comic sigh and played upon his cithern as he saw the herren die there are fourandtwenty dead men alying in the room the tapers burning lowly all fading into gloom the waiters with the music have all in terror fled there sits alone narr hans’l asinging to the dead asinging wailing ditties all in the saddest strain how they poisoned him with pepper and he poisoned them again till he screams “it all is overand the wine is of the best” he drank a flowing goblet and is lying with the rest’ ‘it is a sad song’ murmured breitmann as he struck the last chorus ‘very sad’ replied the nightingales ‘it makes me cry’ chirped the sparrow ‘mournful indeed’ sang the evening breeze ‘well away there’s a lesson in it for all’ concluded flaxius comment by the editorif there are any readers who would prefer these ballads of hans breitmann in the original german english he or she may find them and many more quite as good or betteror even worsein a little book entitled hans breitmann in germany published by t fisher unwin of which book several critics remarked that there was so much german in it as to render it unintelligible which as elsewhere remarked was much like declaring that there is too much latin in the poems of virgil or horace or in truth of merlinus coccaius or the bard who sang the polemomiddiana so reflecting on him who proposed to make a translation of carlyle’s sartor resartus into english the editor has ventured to clothe these two breitmann ballads in so much of our current tongue as his humble means permitted which reminds him of a little story there was once a french artist who found a picturesque old beggar on the pont neuf the beggar was striking il sautait aux yeux he leapt to your eyes he was seventy years of age he had a long white beard he was clad in a long picturesque ragged gabardine a gabardine is a dressinggown for ladies it is a peignoir short sentences make long copy copy is paid for by the page to return to our sheep the beggar held a long rude staff like esculapius or a chinese barber the artist was charmed with his appearance he asked the beggar to come next day to his studio the beggar assented now as he had never had his portrait taken before the beggar supposed that he must come in his best that is to say endimanché that is to say in sunday togs so he removed his beard and appeared in a shabby steelpen or tailcoat with a cane with a glass head and his shoes blacked and a red waistcoat when the artist beheld him he exclaimed with horror ‘oh mon dieu you are spoiled you are spoiled’ now if this artist had been a leonardo da vinci who could make a beautiful madonna out of an old man as a model he would have copied the beggar all the same seeing the reality which was in him but he did not see it 7 ‘over the pumpkin’ also the sunflower ie openly these being very visible objects 8 jackfool flaxius in india the story of sakhara and arjun with the wonderful transmigrations of dschim crow ‘gli indiani e i persiani e in generale tutti gli orientali ammettevano la metempsicosi come un dogma particolare al quale erano molto affezionati’ gran dizionario infernale da francesco pique now it befel once in the golden time meaning the goodolden or aureate age which hesiod and other poets write of that flaxius having seen the dragon world with all its thousand brazen eyes of glittering cities and looked bravely at them and read their meaning found himself in northwestern india in a then famous city called chotahazripoora as for the date it was somewhere the other side of the year one which is tolerably accurate chronology for indian records which were not very well kept by the sanskrit civil service about that time or any other with all their wisdom and in this particular poora which is in greek and gypsy foros whence forum so called from its great wealth flaxius became a great man at court because he despised riches and was a sage being of course greatly honoured and admired and coloured up as an incongruity and inexpensive at that and at last the king consulted with him on all matters social familiar or financial from taxing a province down to buying a new bayadere in all of which the immortal displayed singular sagacity and exquisite good taste this monarch had of course three sons by which ye may know that i have started on a fairy tale the head of which is as usual the part which comes last or the youngest this third became very dear to flaxius because he was a brave frank innocent clever youth worth looking after and loving and his name was arjūn now in the gust and whirlwind and flit and flow of hailstones and raindrops which make the pelting incidents of courtlife there being little rest or peace in it flaxius began to note that a cloud was coming over the soul of arjūn and from this antechamber of the dream he soon passed to the bright hall of perception that his pupil or friend was in love and ere long the expected confidence came in these words ‘thou knowest o wise among men that i have never set my heart on love of woman for the article in its best quality has ever been so exceeding cheap and abundant about our court and i have had so freely my pick and choice of primeurs that it was unto me only as my meals moreover all the books which i have studied have taught me that the preferring one girl to another is mere idle fancy even as tastes in food are simply the result of caprice and custom and that female nature is all in fact folly this i did steadfastly believe till it chanced that one day in the woods far beyond the city i met with a maid of exceeding beauty who as i found by conversation was so witty and wise original and good that it soon appeared to me that i had all along been in ignorance and error as to what woman might be and in short all my philosophy went to the seven hells where it may remain for ever for all i care being in love through and throughdyed in the grain ‘and this girl sakhára is the daughter of a brahmin of kingly race but exceeding poor so when i told my father of my love’ ‘why then’ interposed flaxius ‘“fire flashed from the monarch’s eyes and high his wrath began to rise”’ ‘yea’ replied arjūn ‘and in short he swore by the cow that i should never marry her unless it were shown to be the special will of the gods’ ‘h’m’ observed flaxius ‘i have noticed that the special will of the gods is generally manifest in anything to which we agree and could the king be brought to assent to this in any way the divine sanction would soon be perceptible therefore my son fret not thy soul but go and amuse thyself for in lovetroubles as in all others he who is least uneasy comes the soonest to ease i will see what can be done’ it came to pass that the next day flaxius while walking in the forest and listening to the chattering of the holy monkeys in the trees o’erheadwhose conversation was however of a most frivolous and unholy charactermet with a man who was evidently a poor devil on general principles but who appeared to be a decidedly superior person when one investigated the particulars for he had a very intelligent face of dark hue a keen shrewd eye and a goodly mien he was clad in black ‘i beg you great sir’ he said to flaxius ‘to take heed how you speak to me or even look at me or let my shadow fall on you else you will find yourself in for hell or a long penance for i am a pariah and my name is dschim crow’ ‘and i’ replied flaxius ‘not being a fool and having travelled in many lands and seen the vanity of all things human would probably be ranked with you could the brahmins read my soul’ ‘ay’ answered the outcast ‘’tis one of the precepts of our philosophy that mankind are all divisible into the foundout and the notfoundout’ ‘a good saying’ replied flaxius ‘have ye then a philosophy’ ‘we are the only true philosophers’ answered the pariah ‘for ours is the sole system that teaches the error of excess of wisdom law and goodness as is shown by our literature which comprises every work of true humour ever written in india’ ‘better and better’ said flaxius ‘and i believe you the more because such a literature is the natural result of such a principle and what are some of the works to which you refer’ ‘there is firstly’ answered the outlaw ‘the story of “vikram and the vampire” in which the baital teaches the sage in a series of twentyfive lessons how to show himself a fool just two dozen times by being over wise ‘secondly the “life of the gūrū simple” by which we may learn that a good man may be a great goose ‘thirdly the “marvellous tale” showing how boorumbunder pop the buddhist broke open a poultryhouse and stole all the fowls by virtue of the holy fourteen formulas of sakhya mūni ‘fourthly how ahsin the chinese sage who had been converted to the true religion and came to the gate of nirvana descended to earth and meeting brahma on a pilgrimage in human form cheated him out of all his money at cards ‘fifthly how the holy brahmin baro chor pilfered from the divine cow of waschischta a pint of the milk of experience from which he churned the butter of wisdom which is in twenty thousand slokas or verses ‘parraco tute’ replied flaxius in prakrit ‘i had rather thou wouldst read it than i any more’ ‘there is the divine legend how krishna the chastest of the gods made love in extreme to twenty thousand milkmaids all at once with the moral of “be virtuous and you will be happy” after which he was always blue in the face’ ‘truly i do not wonder at it’ remarked flaxius ‘i have seen a man look blue for less than that any more’ ‘well there is the thieves’ bible teaching the divine worship of kàli which they study devoutly in spirit and in truth all the more because it teaches them how to commit burglary personal theft and murder ‘and with this the bāro lil or scripture of the trablūs dom who call themselves the rom or romany teaching the sanctity of stealing shirts from clotheslines the piety of pilfering hens the holy art of passing off bad horses for good and the divineness of telling fortunes’ ‘a goodly library’ remarked flaxius ‘dost thou know aught of magic’ ‘i have picked up a few tricks’ replied the pariah ‘which i learned from a mahatma such as the three card game thimblerig floating in the air putting cigarettes under cushions and sending letters from a distance my one great game is however to turn a girl into a tree or the reverse but with all my fine accomplishments i could never conjure up my wife or a dinner and i need a meal now most deucedly’ ‘friend’ said flaxius ‘i will conjure thee up a good dinner and teach thee the art of doing it if thou wilt impart to me those tricks of thine’ ‘by yamen’ cried the jovial bohemian ‘thou art generous for i deem thy secret worth forty of mine any day he who hath a woman may have nothing to eat but devil the place was i ever in where if i had a bountiful dinner i could not get a girl to share it with me by the way’ he inquired ‘does this dinner of yours embrace drinknot water you know but tátto pani or spirits’ ‘also that’ said flaxius with a smile ‘behold’ there was not far from them a large earthenware pot left by some traveller flaxius bade the outcast dig a hole in the ground in this the pot upside down was halfburied then he chanted in a mystic ancient indian tongue ‘baro duvel dikkamì kūshto hāben well avri o choro rom se bokalo kekno māss kek kokalo kekno kil ne kel pā mui bitcha leste sari dui te tatto pani kater rom om mani padmi hom’9 ‘mighty spirit look on me let a dinner come from thee outcast hungers here alone hath no meat and ne’er a bone cheese nor butter for his mouth send to him i pray thee both also spirits in this hour o jewel in the lotus flower’ and this done the feast began for on removing the pot there appeared beneath it a rice curry surmounted with a fine piece of roast beef garnished with chillies two chupattis or wheatcakes jaggree sugar and a great flask ‘now by the thousand years in hell which i am to catch for eating that beef’ exclaimed the outcast ‘i call that a good meal thank the devil and your lordshipif ye be not one and the sameand for what i am about to devour make us truly thankful’ as the tiger said when he ate up the buddha yeck lav se tacho sā desh ‘one word’s as good as ten leather awayamen’ ‘and toddyby all the goblins’ he exclaimed as he sampled the bottle ‘strong and abundant enough to demoralise an elephant verily i can now be clear through to the further end of my ideal of bliss for as your lordship knows that man is a bachtalo beng or lucky devil who knows when he is well off or as the great sanskrit poet jan kitz sings ‘“it is a flaw in happiness to see beyond our bourne it forces us in summer skies to mourn and spoils the singing of the nightingale” ‘therefore let us not see beyond our bourneat least not till we get there which as our great ancestor cain says in his precepts is more than most men manage to do’ ‘was cain thy ancestor’ inquired flaxius ‘i would fain hear the legend if one there be’ ‘thou shalt hear it in spirit and in truth’ replied the outcast ‘in the spirit of toddy and on the truth of a gypsy know then what is known to everybody of every language and in every land that in the beginning were cainos and abelos and unto them was a sister and cainos slew his brother and took his sister to wife but she being told that it was wrong fled from him and took refuge in the sun where she dwells to this day then cainos for all his sins was sent to live in the moon and because it is cold there he is always bearing thorns to feed the fire and longing for his sister he in the moon ever pursues her but others say that when the sun has set and ere the moon has risen then they meet which accounts for their love lasting so long since they do not see too much of one another but however it be they are gods of all us wanderers because they are always wandering over the heavens and we are their descendants and therefore under a curse for which indeed we do not care a cursewhen we can get toddy ‘“when the evening fire is burning and the women return from town and the crows to their nests returning we will drink till the moon goes down and merrily sing and prattle while music rings over the plain and if there’s enough in the bottle we’ll drink till she rises again” ‘now the sun is called in our tongue kam or kàn and the moon tchen or zen even as tongues turn it hence we their children are the zenkan or zingan and this is the true story of our race whence ye may see what a fine lot we are ‘and now your illustriousness since it takes two to make a bargain or as a bargain requires a pair which must consist of a couple and as duality demands separate units or a double of singles and a duplicate repeated units and twins bifold births and as according to the vedas there are needed twicefive fingers to make a handshake and the shastras assert that if one parent be wanting there can be no child born ‘heavenamercy man’ cried flaxius ‘what the devil art thou driving at’ ‘only this o heaven born that as thou hast kept thy word and given me the dinner without an end and the flask inexhaustible i will forthwith repay reciprocate discharge settle acquit bequests with strike a balance clear off old scores liquidate poney up my dues to the tune of “on the nail” and show myself a man of honour and a gentleman by telling thee how to turn a tree into a girl or a girl into a tree albeit i do not guarantee the quality of the timber but by their fruit shall ye know them’ ‘’tis well’ answered flaxius ‘proceed with thy process’ and the outcast proceeded but here i must draw the veil of secrecy over the mirror of curiosity i did not mind o reader letting thee know how to raise a dinner by means of sorcery but i draw the line at girls for there are as it is rather too many girls in the world if we may believe the census and too few trees if we are to put faith in agricultural newspapers and therefore i think it just as well that this metamorphosis be not added to those of daphne and the dryads when flaxius returned to the ruppenygav or silver city of chotahazripoora he went straight to the golden palace or sonafilisin and entered the tatchobar kamora or diamond chamber where he found the king shadowing the day time of his lordly soul in the dark void of night with sleepless woe which is to say that he was in a gloomy fit of the blues and bored to death ‘sarshān your majesty how art thou’ inquired flaxius in the court tongue ‘sarshān yer kokero puro how are you yourself o ancient’ replied the mighty monarch ‘as for me i am in trouble i have as thou knowest more than a thousand mothersinlaw in my family’ ‘yea’ replied flaxius ‘and i have known a man ere now to be always in hot water with only one’ ‘and they are all nagging me to get first of all my three sons married and then the daughters canst thou see a way out of it’ he added anxiously flaxius reflected a long time in order not to make his wisdom too cheap nor yet ‘to set himself by flippancy too light too high above the level of his king’ and then replied ‘thou knowest o sublime superiority that i have deeply studied the science of dreams and can command them therefore will i somnambulate in sleep and draw conclusion from its imagery ‘“the figments and conceits the myths and fads the grey chimeras and the visions blue the phantasms and shadows of the soul the whims and vagaries and rhapsodies extravaganzas of the booming soul the humbugs which go sailing in the dark the airdrawn dodgers and the bugbears wild the flying dutchmen in the sea of sleep the castles in the air and homes i’ the moon utopias and fair atlantises the happy valleys of the bards of yore the fairy lands and the millenia of prester john and of micomicon wherein alnaschar found le pot au lait and where the fay morgana rules supreme shall be explored down to their deepest dream and the last shadow of their last ideal and the last fairy coin struck in their mint be studied deeply in the minutest case to answer well thy question o my king”’ ‘s’e pmi duvel as my spirit may help me’ cried the monarch in admiration ‘i will say this for thee flaxius that beside thee as a bard kalidasa is nowhere and that what thou canst not do in poetry is not worth adoing therefore let us drink’ and they drank when flaxius appeared the next morning before his majesty it was with the grand and important air of a man who has been dreaming on a royal order and filled up every detail in first class style the courtiers looked at him with awe and even his highness regarded him with a kind of fearful respect as if apprehending that he might go off or explode or burst in some mysterious way he was manifestly relieved when an attendant maiden brought to the sage a golden goblet of soma or india pale ale and when the wise man had drained off about a pint thereof he sighed as if all danger of a conflagration was for the time extinguished so great a thing is it to be known to be possessed of a secret ‘by your majesty’s royal command’ said flaxiusand all around became as still as the micestars in heaven before the catmoon‘by your majesty’s royal command i dreamed and i found myself in a far isle of light holding a trumpet shell of pearly hue which glendoveers do blow whene’er they meet then from a bowery strand just oppositean island of the seathere came enchantment with the shifting wind that did both drown and keep alive my ears and as i listened all my sense was filled with that new blissful golden melody a living death was in each gust of sounds each family of rapturous hurried notes aunts cousins nieces daughters all most beautiful fell one after one yet all at once like pearl beads dropping sudden from their strings’ ‘ahem’ muttered the outcast who had in the daring disguise of a respectable person found his way into the assembly ‘it seems to me that i have heard something like that before’ ‘then’ continued flaxius ‘there rose amid wild clouds incarnadine the form of siva with his glory on he bore in one hand the triçula or trident and without speaking he pointed impressively at its three points’ all present were in breathless awe ‘then he disappeared and i beheld the terrible vishnu he held up his three fingers and vanished in turn ‘and anon from the cloud there came an awful rakhshi or demon and he held up three arrowswinked at me and nodded and disappeared in a clap of thunder ‘from which i learned o king that thou must gather together all the most beautiful princesses who are eligible then turn all the people in the town out of their houses for one day and put a princess into every house’ the excitement was at its height ‘then o king let thy three sons armed with bows and arrows send each a shaft at random into the city and where it hits there will each bride be found’ ‘what thou hast said o flaxius shall be done’ replied the king and it was done secundum artem in the proper way each prince took his place at the great window and let fly an arrow the eldest and the secondbest son one after the other hit a house it was considered a great miracle that both of them were perfectly delighted with the success which attended their aim but flaxius observing a wink in the eye of the outcast elicited from him the fact that both of the princes who were excellent archers had been previously and respectively in love with these very girls and that there had been in fact a little arrangement made by the help of the gypsy for as rum kove the poet sang in zend full many a shaft at random sent hits mark the archer surely meant now it happened that arjūn the youngest could pull the long bow better than any of them in fact he had been heard to say that he could split a hair at a hundred yards or hit a thunderbolt with a bolt head as it passed whizzing by and there was in the armoury of the palace a mighty bow which no one else on earth could bend which he chose for this occasion but by the secret suggestion of flaxius he aimed over the town and when he discharged the arrow he gave the bow and it at the instant a peculiar impulse which skilled archers understand so that the shaft flew miles away far into the forest then messengers were sent to trace its course which they did and on returning repeated that they had found it sticking in the top of a tamarindtree in the foliage like a hairpin passed through the chignon or gathered hair of a maiden so the king summoned flaxius and all the learned men to know what should be done and it was unanimously agreed that arjūn must marry the tree there being many precedents to prove that trees were a kind of human beings only that they grew with their heads in the ground their forked branches being legs also that according to legends of many lands men have descended from them on which subject the outcast expressed his assent sotto voce to flaxius but added that he believed the said men had first ascended them to steal fruit so there was a procession formed and going to the tamarindtree the king and prince and all concerned bowed before it expressing hopes that it was in good health and finally proposed the marriage when at that instant came a charming breeze before which the tree bowed its head as if in assent and the match was concluded then rich gifts were laid before the bride and left there with a guard and the king and his cortège returned home when lo the next day there were found spread on a table in the grand hall of the palace other gifts exceeding rich with a purple scroll on which was inscribed in letters of silver ‘the tamarind herself commends and to the prince these presents sends and humbly begs of him that he will seek the forest speedily unto the spot where she doth bide and bear away his loving bride’ so they all went once more and when they were before the tree they saw it slowly shrink to smaller space its foliage turning into curling hair till in its place there stood a maiden fair and this was of course the fair sakhara who being found to be of royal blood was duly wedded to arjūnthe king sagely observing that ‘it was manifestly the will of the gods’ and here endeth the story of her and of arjūn now by the powerful influence of flaxius there was a special investigation of the case of the outcast by the entire college of brahmins with a view to his rehabilitation since there were precedents for it and it was found that in a previous existence a million of years before he had been a crow and of him the most learned of the brahmins discovered the following history of his jatakas in an ancient sanscrit scroll the history of bhusanda contemplate steadfastly the divine glory cast thy soul into the sparkling depths of the infinite sea whose fishes are gods whose waves are the ages it is written in the ramayana it was told of yore by the rishis once there was a man named bhusanda who was the crow that related to the eagle garuda the bird of vishnu the deeds of rama to convince him that the latter was greater than shiva and vishnu nor was bhusanda utterly evil neither was he bad but the spirit of mockery was in him for ever doing good deeds he wanted reverence he was as a silver bell with a flaw and when a youth bhusanda was worshipping shiva in the temple there entered the holy gūrū his teacher and bhusanda seeing him enter for a jest being also mightily exalted with ideas of his own wisdom did not greet or notice his gūrū which thing the teacher in his extreme humility and mildness would have passed unnoted but the god above in his rage at this insolence thundered from heaven at bhusanda the awful doom of eternal damnation then the gūrū who knew not revenge or anger flung himself on his face before the god and prayed for a remission of the sentence and the god relenting said ‘he shall pass through one thousand transformations in all of them shall he be poor but crafty and wise he shall adore vishnu yet ever call aloud my name’ then after his death he became a serpent and so passed through a thousand forms and at last became a brahmin again yet was he still as erst incorrigible and the devilry of quizzing and satire would not leave his heart despite his goodness among men gods and devils no one dared so much as he for a joke now there are ten sons of brahma even the ten rishis and these are daksha pulastya agni washishta brigu atri maritshi narada pulagen kratū each of themall of themtruly an awful gooroo and one day when one of these was lecturing on the attributes of god his own father bhusanda ventured to differ with him in opinion yea even to contradict him whereupon the rishi in a rage at such stupendous impudence condemned him in his next life to become a crow which he did but took it all so cheerfully and continued to say so many good things that the rishi to soften the sentence taught him to call the name of rama whom the romi or gypsies worship and from whom they take their name the crow being among the brahmins the symbol of the sun who is the mother of the romany now when rama was born the crow flew unto him and accompanied him in all his childhood and as the god performed his great deeds bhusanda every morning on the top of the blue mountain narrated them to all the birds assembled who spread them over all the world and so in due time it was written that he should become a man again named dschim crow and turn up some day or other at the court of the city of chotahazripoora in company with a great and marvellous sage named f here the manuscript ended abruptly and it seemed to one or two experts present that these last lines were in a somewhat different ink from the rest and looked like a later addition but these profitably held their peace and as it was a tremendous feather in the caps of the assembled brahmins to have discovered the long lost crow they made the most of him whereupon the crow fell into a trance which lasted many hours and when he recovered he narrated how rama had appeared unto him in a vision and assured him that every one of the brahmins there present was destined to become a numberone god in the next generation and to keep on rising for nine hundred and ninetyfour million kalpacs and then attain nirvana also that the whole party including himself while here on earth would be deemed incapable of committing any sin or crime he had indeed received as a first instalment of plenary indulgence a special dispensation and injunction to drink aràk toddy in honour of rama to be supplied to him by the sacred college whereupon he was invested with the yellow thread and declared to be a saint it was midnight and flaxius and dschim crow sat on either side of a pearlinlaid table on seats set with gems and between them was the holy bottle with gold cups ‘well’ observed flaxius ‘of all the infernal lying coldfrozen brazen impudent cheeky humbugs whom i ever encountered on earth thou my son dost take the cake but yesterday a pariah and today directing all the brahmins as their chief’ ‘que veuxtu mon vieux’ replied the holy crow who in his new capacity of divine of course divined all the languages of the future ‘surely ’tis not by modesty that gods attain to what they be for face and cheek since time began were aye the noblest part of man and he who hath but impudence to all things hath sublime pretence for the very essence of the most orthodox religion is that man is to be saved by faith alone good works being only manifestations of faith and of all faith ever roasted or toasted stewed or brewed in the kitchen of theology there is none like a holy faith in one’s own self pious autoreliance devout assurance divine audacity and sanctified lookingdown on everybody which latter is the true secret of all ecclesiastical supremacy and influence as we saints well know ‘and note you that this full faith and belief in oneself is neither egoism nor egotism but only religion directed inward devotion which has gone to the heart instead of striking outward into pharisaical displays of modesty wherewith the world is more deluded and gulled than by all the good honest boldness ever obtruded on it for he who believes in his lucky star brings to the battle of life ninetenths of victory therefore o illustrious patron i pray you believe that this which you call cheek in me is indeed no vanity or idle desire to be admired by the world for which i verily do not care three straws esteeming its praise or blame as all stuff and taradiddle ‘trumpery trash rubbish and hum fatras frippery bubble and scum leatherprunella drugs and chaff refuse sweepings sediment raff trifling paltry petty or small frivolous stuff worth nothing at all hardly anything no great shakes peu de chose and as farthing stakes gimcracks whimwhams gammon and sells fiddlestick fudge and bagatelles paltry pitiful twopenny flams fribbling beggarly pitiful crams not worth mentioning nor a rush stuff and nonsense humbug and tush ‘for verily at that and nothing more do i esteem vanity and the notice of the world or personal notoriety or puffs while to my taste all applause homage heroworship clapping hosannahs glorification and acclamation raw or cooked save so far that there is fun in it all may go to the devil and shake itself but he who is what you may call selfsuperstitious or guided in all things as he thinks by a dæmon or star or fairy or fate or strange omens by occult desires and coincidences always becomes strangely selfconfident and yet not vain or egoistic because he feels as if he were a wheelbarrow trundled by his god ‘or a top spun by a boy or clay in the potter’s hands or dough being kneaded or a horse in harness or paper under the pen or a maid taken by force or potatoes being mashed or type being set or a garment being shaped or a rocket set fire to or a fiddle being played or an arrow shot from a bow or a cake being mixed or a twine in cat’scradle or a sermon being preached or a puppet being played or a pig driven to market or a football in a game or a top being spun or a boat being steered or anything or anybody under external direction now the egoist believes himself to be and the vain man is sure that he is the actor and the thing acted on all in one but the blind believer in self is only confident that he is welldirected eccomi’ ‘a subtle distinction’ said flaxius ‘and not without truth’ ‘moreover and this should be noted’ resumed the holy crow ‘he who is by god’s grace even a little of a humourist is above all men most likely to be misunderstood in this matter for verily i swear by this holy bottle that when i took no notice of the gūrū for which shiva wished to send me to hell ’twas not from vanity of great wisdom as those lying old devils the brahmins declared but just to see what sort of a rum face he would cut and when i disputed with the son of brahma as to the divine attributes of his father i hope i may be split salted and dried in hell like a fish if it was that i pretended to know more about the governor than he did devil a bit nay it was only that the fiend of fun inspired me to a stupendous palpable absurdity which rightly understood was an act of the deepest reverence but the rishi was a fool even as the brahmins and old vish himself were also and shiv into the bargain’ ‘i believe thee o crow’ replied flaxius ‘and it is true that the dull world often attributes to selfconceit that which is truly an artistic or humorously inspired conception many a creator and artist have i seen carried away by pride or faith in his inspiration who had god wot little pride in himself but o dschim crow he had as thou ever hast the sublime enjoyment of the joke or idea albeit gods and men missed the point’ ‘amen’ quoth the crow ‘let us drink’ ‘and now’ quoth flaxius ‘that the sun shines thou wilt i suppose begin to make hay or lay up money for the rainy days’ ‘by the wheel of heaven not i’ exclaimed the crow ‘he that saves up money keeps it from circulating which is a great crime yea a robbery of the widow and the orphan albeit should such a chance occur of saving up money at another man’s expense as once befell me i will not say that i will utterly reject it one ought to have cash in hand for holy charities and small treats’ ‘i pray thee tell me the tale’ answered flaxius ‘that will i’ exclaimed the crow after a drink ‘once upon a time when bramadatta was reigning in benares in kasi it befell that i was born and when i grew up i had a small place under the treasurer bunder shroff kash ‘one day i bewailed that i was poor and the treasurer overhearing me told it to the king at his elbow and the king calling me said ‘“excellent young man it is very easy to get rich remember that a penny saved is a penny earned now to encourage i will give thee an order on the treasury commanding that when thou shalt have saved a penny it shall be doubled” ‘“may your glory endure for ever o life of the world” i replied “but while you are about it make it pence” ‘he did so and the order was written but the king forgot to limit the payment he thought i would only draw once or a penny at a time but i knew a trick worth two of that i went with my penny and drew another ‘the next day i came and said “i have saved twopence pray pay the equivalent” the next day i brought fourpence and the next eight and so it went on till ere long the treasurer begged for credit now i paid the treasurer a handsome percentage to keep quietand he quieted but at last the thing got beyond all bounds and the treasurer one day informed the king that he was bankrupt and owed more than the whole kingdom was worth and all the world with it for the sum due me was lakhs of rupees 972687265390221 ‘then the king got into a fine rage and would fain have had me put to death but the treasurer said “your majesty it would be better to compromise with such a brilliant financier and employ him to collect the taxes” which was done ‘when this lesson was ended the supreme deity the allknowing one himself repeated this stanza ‘“with humblest start on a trifling capital a shrewd and able man will rise to wealth e’en as his breath can nurse a tiny flame” ‘and there are many tables and fables in which something like this is to be found or will be as for instance the jātakas from the pali edited by professor e b cowell who will in a future age be known as a great good wise illustrious and learned sanskritist and in the parables of buddhagosha and dhammapady or the accused irishman and the divyāvadāna and the kathā sārit sāgara but mine note ye is the original jacobs and the first true prototype model pattern precedent protoplast mould ensample matrix and paradigm of them all all the rest of them being mere reechoes shadows reflexes apographs and adumbrations of mine selah’ ‘and how long dost thou expect to remain here in clover o incarnation of bhusanda and favourite of rama’ inquired flaxius ‘i hope to run the machine of the sacred college’ replied the crow critically eyeing his liquor ‘till a spring breaks or a screw comes looseor what is quite as likely till i find the affair is slow and the fun giving outwhen i will start as a yoghi on a pilgrimage or a banjari or nātjeckno covva miri hai’ ‘’tis all one to me where on earth i be so i only pass the time in jollity where the girls abound and good drink is found and a changing round of life i ever see with a toldiddle and a roldiddle and a tolderolderolde diddle dee ‘allso camarado buona sera meet me again in life when life seems dull’ ‘hæc fabula docet’ wrote flaxius ‘that in this life we should not be too much guided by appearances for firstly the tale of sakhara and arjun as it occurs in the asiatic journal of 1829 whence it was transferred by grimm to his work on women’s names derived from plants might seem to many to have been the original source whereas it is only a mutilated and abridged version as appears from the fact that i who had so much to do with the plot am not mentioned in it nor does dschim crow once occur in the story neither are there in it those beautiful specimens of indian poetry in the original romany or romanyana dialect allied to sanskrit which prove the fidelity of my text ‘secondly that the king did not surmise that there was any “working of the oracle” as regarded the shooting of the three arrows or that the will of the gods is sometimes managed even by such characters as the crow for it was the crow indeed who pulled all the wires wrote the lady’s letter and told all the needful lies on this occasion ‘thirdly that it came not to the surface neither did it appear to man that dschim crow who was an expert penman added that little postscript to the old manuscript ‘fourthly that it is most probable that the vast majority of my readers will fondly believe that i am the author of the old ms history of bhusanda whereas it is really given in the ramayana and extracted therefrom by nork in his symbolischesmythologisches realwörterbuch vol i p 259 ‘fifthly that brahma siva vishnu and co including all the saints were utterly mistaken in the true character of the crow even as a reviewer sometimes is at the present day when he adventures into literature now this showing how the hindoo trinity made a fool of itself firstly by putting pantagruelism into a crow and then expecting to ever get it out is i am sure one of those subtle sarcasms of the pariah literature which worked its way into the regular scriptures somewhat in the same way as the erotic or erratic melodrama of the song of solomon was insinuated probably by some hebrew joker into the old testament ‘sixthly that as there are substances which to the vulgar sense seem to be one and the same yet which chemistry shows are radically different elements so there are natures like that of the crow which do not care twopence for applause or what the world thinks of them and yet are called egoistic when their inspiration consists in yielding to influences which had they guided them might indeed have caused them to be called vain ‘seventhly that the crow being incorrigible and incurable will continue to manifest himself as a poor devil and be considered as “a comic fella doncher know” and as nothing but a swell jesteruntil gods and saints get more sense’ 9 this exquisitely beautiful incantation poem will be readily intelligible to every sanskritist with the exception perhaps of the last line which is in a later vulgar dialect it means accurately translated ‘i am a gypsy foottraveller’ in common dialect it would be ‘romani patengro shom’ omani for ‘romany’ occurs in the english gypsies and their language the wonderful story of miss jesabelle rockhard with a serious vindication of her prototypes or flaxius in england ‘and thus outspoke ye oracle a very truth to thee i tell if thou canst a woman finde with such an earthsubduing minde and with soule so stern and deepe that she can a secret keepe then know of verie truth that she a great enchauntresse soon will be a queen in soothe or faery’ it was five o’clock tea at lady puddlebrooke’sa somewhat famous weekly rendezvous which many called ‘the meet’ because there assembled on the occasion so many gallant hunters of gossip and harriers of character who were soon let slip in full cry of the chronique scandaleuse of the day the which chronicle be it remarked by the way is by far the most wonderful flying leaf as such journals were once called which was ever compiled since every soul implicitly believes that there is in it the name of everybody else and that all which is said of others in it is true while their own names are never thereor if there invariably attached to falsehoods and out of place now while all the good christians philanthropists nobly honest agnostics angelic virgins who had been presented dignified and ferocious matrons clergymen positivists and other seekers after truth wereas a nasty cynical journalist who was present remarked‘ravening and battening on their garbage’ which meant repeating what they had read in the society papers or preparing what would soon appear in them flaxius had withdrawn to a quiet corner and an easy sofa where he was joined by miss jesabelle rockhard a lady of whom all her friends said ‘it certainly cannot be denied that she is goodlooking’ others limiting this praise to ‘distinguée’ while some reduced it to ‘striking’ which she certainly was being a hard hitter in conversation and not above fibbing when it came to a scratch that she was ‘highly intelligent’ and an esprit fort gifted with the unscrupulousness which she herself graced with the name of will was manifested at a glance and impressively set forth by the first utterance of her voice to any reader of the human heart she was between afternoon and twilight as regarded age and of very limited means facts which she stated with the utmost candour to everybody nor was she devoid of a certain intuition or clairvoyance as regarded ability in others as she had creditably shown by divining that flaxius was a character she determined that she would draw him out to the last hair and completely ascertain all there was in him in forming this resolution she had as the americans express it unconsciously ‘taken out a mighty big contract’ which was the further impeded by the fact that the party of the other part knew exactly how much stock she held and what was her capital while shepoor little soulknew nothing at all as to the resources of the adversary but she came up to the assault gallantly there was something in her very smile with its pinch in the lips and in the ring of her keen voice which seemed to say ‘i’m arch and airy with the gay sarcastic tone of society you must accept all my stings with a delighted airand you’ll be in bad form if you don’t beware beware’ ‘ah mr flaxius just as one would expectwithdrawn from the gossiping frivolous crowd you set up to be intellectual i believe’ there are certain very common and very silly speeches of this kind current which tease sensible people because they are hard to answer so true is it that a fool can roll a stone into a well which fifty wise men cannot get out but flaxius replied with divine suavity ‘if being out of the swim is a sign of setting up to be intellectual then i suppose as you are here that you also advance the same claim and would fain remind me of it’ here the smile was beautifully genial as if to say ‘’tis all my fun’ ‘confound his cheeky impudence’ thought miss jesabelle and she promptly countered ‘so you do set up to be intellectual then oh you needn’t deny ityou’ve admitted it’ ‘true’ exclaimed flaxius ‘and i have heard from other people the same of you and yet i am not sure’ he added in so dreamy meditative a manner that he seemed to be thinking of anything except miss rockhard ‘that ’tis not better to be able to set oneself up independentlythough ever so littlethan to have to rely on others to do it for us’ and looking at miss jesabelle with a smile that was childlike and bland he added ‘ask me some more of those hard questions please’ ‘i really believe’ answered the lady with some acerbity ‘aha’ thought flaxius ‘the first blood drawn’‘that you must have belonged to the disagreeable club whose members make a practice of irritating and retorting like cabmen’ ‘ah’ exclaimed flaxius ‘if i had not i should have been indeed illqualified for conversation with an advanced young lady of the fin de siècle how often she reminds me of a spanish fairytale may i tell it’ he asked like a little boy ‘oh certainly if it amuses you’ replied the young lady in a tone halfcontemptuously vexed yet half interested in this extraordinary stranger ‘once upon a time’ said flaxius ‘there were three brothers and the two elder were a pair of awful blackguards’ ‘truly it begins beautifully’ remarked miss rockhard scornfully ‘doesn’t it’ quoth flaxius gleefully ‘and it’s nothing to what’s acoming well there was a king of the country and he had a beautiful daughterat least she was distinguée or what you might call stunning for she was awful at being disagreeable and could shut up any man in chaff or worsenot to draw it too fine and if anybody dared to answer heroh then she became angry ‘now the king finding that his daughter kept his court all the time in an uproar issued a proclamation saying that whoever could beat the princess in abuse should have her to wife and welcome then the two elder brothers rejoiced each being sure that he would win the prize but the younger who was a sort of saint johnny with no great gift of the gab went and sat sorrowfully in the woods weeping to think he had no chance to win the princess and wishing he had passed his boyhood in playing chuckfarthing and hanging about the docks with other little guttersnipes and had not wasted it in going to school and church and pennyreadings ‘and while he sat there weeping and eating a great slice of watermelon mingling his tears with the seeds there came by an irish fairy of his acquaintance ‘“an’ what is it yees wapein an’ bodderin’ about alanna” she asked kindly ‘then the youth told her his trouble and how he would like to win the princess but wanted that copia verborum or elegant “fluency of sass” as it is called in america which was necessary to secure it ‘“och monoma diaoul and tear and agers” exclaimed the fairy “sure if it’s nothin’ but blaygairdin’ is naded it’s mesilf that’ll tache ye how to bate thim all intoirely pattherin’ an’ cantin’ is it and me here that blissed the great daniel o’connell in his cradle an’ gave him the illigant spache that shut up all the sass in parliamint ‘“great o’connell the libherather an’ salvathor of oireland’s oisle ‘“whoop fanaballah and eringobraugh” cried the fairy as she danced in a ring brandishing her broom “and now ye divil sit down till i give yees a lisson in polite litherature” ‘i forbear for certain reasons to give you the conversation which occurred between the princess and the two brothers in which they were utterly silenced then turning to the youngest she exclaimed scornfully ‘“and i suppose you with your white eggfruit face of an idiotic scallawag set up for being intellectualintellectual enough to smash methat is if you know what the word means you number three mackerel with the head gone” ‘“it is just like your antepenultimate superfluitancy to mundivagate anent my candicancy’ replied the youth indignantly ‘thou tramontarian tomboytrollope and trullcat thou quadruplicate quean mopsy minx and metaphrastic harridamereintegrated in thy deligration even to conquassentialitythou mere projectile of an eolipilenay i go so far as to call thee a true ultimatum of the fourth effusiondug up by a divarication of conduplicated metatarsitythou art all this as thy conscience deterrates yea and thou art moreover addicted to lipothymy and all such enormities and vices” ‘thereupon the princess gave it to him back with all that there is in grose’s slang dictionary and romany to bootwhich was pretty bad but when he retorted with a passage from browning’s sordello she gave it up and fell into a fit of rage foaming at the mouth and having recovered she married him and they lived like the devil ever after’ now flaxius had the gift of voice and with it that of the storyteller to the degree of wellnigh transcending language itself for one could read the full meaning of every word in his intonation and eyes and gestures these latter were never extravagant but strangely significant as they well might be since he knew as only the priests of old knew the wonderful sign language which men have found of late years on every etruscan vasemuch of which is still found even among the peasantchildren of italy and as a small group of guests had gathered round to hear the legend there were roars of final laughter in which miss jesabelle herself joined with a goodwill for she had begun to realise that there was a lion in this man and as the story had been told for her she shrewdly made the very best of it ‘you tell a fairytale so well’ she said to flaxius when they were again together and no one near ‘as to make one regret that there are no more fairies or magic or rather that such fancies never were’ ‘and if there were’ replied the sage ‘you and the world would still necessarily remain in ignorance of them’ ‘permit me’ replied miss rockhard ‘to differ with you i presume’ she added with a slightly sarcastic expression ‘that i am quite as likely as you are to be acquainted or possibly familiar with all that has been investigated by sciencethe london library and british museum being open to alland i can assure you that despite madame blavatsky and mr sinnett and colonel olcottvery nice men they arenot the slightest scientific proof of the existence of fairies or magic has ever been detected’ ‘very true’ rejoined flaxius imperturbably ‘i did not say that they existed i only assert that from the very nature of things if they do they must be concealed from man as he now is the more indubitable proof of such occult matters would bring about a premature confusion in humanity which would have disastrous results’ ‘i presume not in certain minds at least’ said miss rockhard with an expression which denoted that she considered herself to be one of this favoured few ‘how can you explain however’ she added ‘that few if any know the mysteries’ ‘simply because there are so few people living who can keep a secret or hold their tongues the one great or tremendous task of the ancient priesthoods as of the modern jesuits was not to get great ideas but to train men to keep quiet and not to tell tales out of school’ ‘there again you are quite wrong’ remarked the lady ‘if mere firm reticence would attract revelation i certainly would be among the favoured on that subject you need not speak further for it simply does not admit discussion i have kept’ she added ‘in my time a secret of vast importance on which the fate of a great family depended for many months till it all blew over’ ‘and then’ reflected flaxius ‘came the great blowup in consequence of her blowing or letting it out i remember it all truly she deserves a lesson for all this do you know’ he added amiably ‘i think miss rockhard that this matter may possibly be tested there is an ugly little old story about certain nuns who wanted a pope to make female confessors and he promised to do so if they would keep a box unopened for a day they all swore on their salvation to do so but the pope was hardly out of the convent before they all ran to the box and lifted the lid when out flew a bird which vanished through the window’ ‘if you think that a silly and slanderous old tale which is only disgraceful to one who tells it is an argument’ said the lady ‘i have no more to say’ ‘but i have this to suggest’ replied flaxius ‘i have heardfor i do not assert itthat there is even now in london a person who is endowed with such strangely supernatural gifts that she may be ranked with the witches or fairies’ ‘at a guinea a visit i presume’ remarked miss rockhard with her sarcastic smile more fully developed than ever ‘merci my means do not permit of such expensive researches into occult philosophy’ ‘ah that is the most remarkable part of it all’ replied flaxius ‘she takes nothing nay she invariably makes very valuable gifts but on the strictest conditions of secrecyand she is to the last degree exacting in this respectas also that those whom she favours shall be gifted with superior intellectsnot led by mere curiosity’ ‘and you expect me to believe this’ ‘certainly not i never said a word as to belief i only say that i believe you will incur no kind of risk or cost if you seek her’ ‘and you will obtain access for me to your witch’ ‘she is not my witch and i have no desire whatever to send you to her i only say that if you will promise on your honour to observe sacred secrecy even as to knowing of her existence i will give you her address’ ‘very well i swear’ ‘she lives in devonshire street near regent’s park there is her card but i give you every warning what you seek will require great truth secrecy and selfcommand and remember’here the face of flaxius assumed an expression which miss rockhard had not seen before and under which she for an instant quailed it was so marvellously strange and dignified as if he had forgotten himself into grandeur‘remember that if you succeed i shall expect no thanks and if you fail yours alone is the responsibility’ ‘oh i accept it’ replied miss rockhard recovering her flippancy ‘thanks awfully i accept the entire responsibility what fun’ and so with all her grace and vanity she swept away at four o’clock on the following afternoonor ‘morning’ as it is called by those who probably look for midnight at fourteen o’clockmiss rockhard found herself in devonshire street seeking the dwelling of the witchfairy and it was very naturally with an intensely sarcastic smile that she finally discovered on a door a small silver plate bearing the words miss alban dressmaker ‘i might have expected it would be some humbug of the kind’ thought the fair jesabelle ‘i wonder whether the fairy drops her h’s but let us enter all the same into this egyptian hall and take a miracle or two’ she rang and was admitted by a very pretty maid to a hall which was somewhat singularly but most artistically decorated with antique objects the real meaning of which was however hardly apparent and was then conducted up a broad old staircase to a large salon in which the visitor detected a most extraordinary and original taste as regards furniture without the least obtrusive sign of expenditure or cost there was not a thing in the room which looked as if it had been the ‘gem’ of a bricabrac shop or worthy a place in the great rothschild pawnbroker collection of frankfort or bought at a demiduffer sale and many of the antiques would not have been valued at twopence by the jew but even miss rockhard albeit her archæology was of the slenderest save on chippendale lace japaneseries chineseries crockeries glass sèvres and rococery in general or trash in particular could not help admitting that there was a hidden depth of knowledge and artistic taste in what she saw which had nothing in common with bargains fashion or the shop suddenly looking up miss rockhard saw before her a lady who though beautiful was not to be lightly described as ‘a beauty’ considering the usual vulgar associations with the word there was a depth of expression and moral truth allied to strength of character in her face which would have shamed into oblivion the charm of a helen who was according to flaxius only a professional beauty of the popular kind after all ‘and such’ adds flaxius ‘i have invariably found all fashionable belles of the season “whom every one is talking about” to be’ ‘i am miss alban’ said the lady to the visitor ‘and i shall be pleased to aid you in the object of your call you desire indubitable proof of the existence of supernatural or magical influences or beings and i can supply it’ ‘you are ahem i believe adressmaker’ said miss rockhard with considerable sarcasm for she felt with every word and glance that miss alban was immeasurably her superior in exactly that in which she would have liked to be great herself or in calm selfpossession penetration and the terrible art of influencing others and being invulnerable therefore it was with something like suppressed exasperation wrapped up in a smile that she exclaimed ‘a dressmaker’ ‘i appear to every one’ replied miss alban looking the other clearly in the eyes ‘as the ideal ministrant of what they most desire in life what you prize above everything is simply to appear well before everybody be it in good looks or clothes as regards the body and accomplishments and setting people down and “besting” them as regards the mind which all amounts to mere show or dress and therefore i appear to you as a modiste’ ‘i confess’ declared miss rockhard who had always with all her failings a substratum of frank courage as regarded her poverty and unavoidable defects being therein no snob ‘that as i have only one decent eveningdress in the world and am getting to the end of my twenties or to a time when dress becomes more needful and as i live for society i do regard externals with love and envy but as for the proof of enchantment’ ‘i promise’ replied miss alban ‘to fully and perfectly convince and satisfy you before you leave this room that there is such a thing as magic by which i mean simply to show you something absolutely inexplicable by your knowledge of science’ ‘i ask no more than that as regards your sorcery’ said miss rockhard with a complacent smile ‘while as to dress i promise that you shall be at no expense and for life the best dressed woman in london or even in new york or paris but on one condition’ ‘i knowabsolute secrecy that for me is a mere trifle’ ‘it is no “mere trifle” as you will find but especially for you a terribly difficult and onerous task for know that the secrecy must be without speck or flaw you are not to say that you have heard of fairy dressmakers or jest with people who ask you whence you had your garments in such a way as to cause surmises as to the truth and if you fail you must not say “i thought this or that” as people of weak minds always do there is to be no allowance for thought or prevarication or independence or misfortune or excuses if you can persevere in merely keeping a secret to your own advantage i promise you that dress shall not be the limit of my favours and you shall lead a long and happy and highlyhonoured life but if you fail that is if by the least inadvertency or even accident you betray the secret you will incur a terrible disgrace and a suffering and humiliated life consider well and do not let your vanity lead you to ruin’ ‘i think’ said miss rockhard with the same old contemptuous smile ‘that we may proceed to the proof as i happen to know my own mind a little better than you probably do i am better aware of my capacity for secrecy i accept your conditions’ ‘the proof is very easy’ replied miss alban taking from a drawer in a cabinet what seemed to be a large walnut ‘did you ever hear of the famous wardrobe walnuts of the witch tree of benevento legend says that a prince once filled a palace with the splendid garments in cloth of gold ermine velvet and pearls which he drew from this one nut10 now are you ready’ ‘certainly’ replied the visitor ‘and should i perform this miracle you will unconditionally once and for all accept it on your honour as a proof of magic power if not we will try something else’ ‘no’ answered jesabelle who was thinking more of being beautifully attired than of all the miracles or oaths ever heard of ‘the dress will be proof enough in all conscience’ as she spoke her outer garment fell off and she stepped out of it while miss alban opening the walnut drew from it what seemed at first to be a mere cobweb which she shook and shook out into greater fulness till she placed it on miss jesabelle who to do her justice had really a fine little figure just made to be very well dressed with the one drawback of large feet and hands ‘now tell me’ said the dressmaker ‘what colour or material or style would you prefer’ ‘nothing extravagant as regards expense’ replied miss rockhard ‘no cloth of gold or pearlembroideries or anything to make people wonder where the money came from when all the world knows how poor i am grey silk will do but as elegant original and beautiful in fit and fold as a robe can be’ ‘c’est fait’ said miss alban ‘rise and look into yonder glass’ then miss rockhard looked and could hardly believe her own eyes such a vision of beauty was before her for as has been already intimated she was really very ‘goodlooking’ with a fine figure both being of the kind which are incredibly improved by tasteful dress so that she came out like fireworks in a grand ball or at a fête when fortune favoured her but never before under the most benign influence of a grand cheque from her benevolent aunt had she bloomed out like this it was more than a fit more than modelling to the form more than artistic folds after any painting for there was in the fluent grace and easy elegance of that skirt and bust an æsthetic apocalypse ‘which is’ pencils flaxius ‘a big word for a man but not too much under the circumstances for a woman’ even the fairy smiled being feminine at the success and said ‘there is still a trifle or two wanting’ she took from the drawer a wisp of straw a coarse cord or circle of clothesline and a simply horrid brooch of brass and glass or of agate which seemed from afar off to have been bought in a common toy shop in the burlington arcade or under the cliff in brighton for threepence she fastened the wisp of straw round the wrist of jesabelle and lo it became a massy bracelet of gold in old etruscan style which would have maddened castellani and sent a whole ballroom into convulsions of envy the brooch turned to a brilliant bouquet of diamonds while the rope with eccentric yet pretty taste remained exactly as it was but in pure gold and being tied in a bowknot with folding ends formed a very original and elegant headdress the world hears a great deal about the tact of women but there is a great deal to be said on the subjectfor and against for while she believed she had the keenest insight into everything miss rockhard like all of her class and kind had no more tact than an oyster or a hedgehog when it behoved her to suppress her needless pleonasms sarcasms and little spasms of ‘pure cussedness’ and over and above all this petty scepticism had so worked into all her being that as soon as she had got over the first flush of admiration at her dress the old devil whispered in her ear not to show too much astonishment or gratitude ‘which means’ he said ‘that she has been too much for you’ therefore with exquisite good taste and characteristic refinement she said ‘well it’s an awfully clever bit of hankypanky i must say i wonder how on earth you do it’ the fairy looked at her gravely and replied ‘you said seriously before i showed you this marvel that if i could effect it you would accept it once and for all as a proof of my power and your first words are an utter denial of it you are neither spontaneously grateful at heart nor graceful nor polite in words society and petty persiflage and small sneering and flippant sarcasm have killed in you every noble quality but i will give you another proof which will defy doubt observe though your figure is good you have undeniably immense hands and your shoes as you are aware really look like badly built gondolas it is a great pity and it cuts you to the very soul now if i reduce these extremities of yours to something like smallness and harmony with the rest will you believe’ what the reader may very well believe is that this speech was as gall wormwood coloquintida nuxvomica rue quassia extract of aloes acetic acid verjuice vitriol and strychnine to the palate of miss rockhard but the end thereof made her forget all these amaritudes and she gasped out ‘yes’ ‘and i am to hear nothing more about “hankypanky” or “how it is done”’ ‘no’ ‘then be it done’ the fairy bade her be seated and took one of her hands in her own and began to sing a spell in a tongue which sounded softly but strangely ‘tānirani sove a lay chovihani chivs apré tiri waster tiri piri boro dukkerin mideary me bitchava lende sā tinknibitti vel ajā little lady go to sleep witch lays spell upon thee deep on thy hands and on thy feet let the charm be strong and fleet so i order one and all to become both neat and small’ so miss rockhard did indeed go to sleep and on awaking found herself in her own home lying on the sofa in her own room ‘she would have thought it all a dream save that round her form was still the dress of the fairy queen which fitted her “like a charm” and her hands and feet were extremely neat and become intensely small “’tis well ’tis well” said jesabelle “for now i shall beat them all”’ it was not long before miss jesabelle rockhard found that the fairy was right in declaring that it was not such an easy matter to keep a secret when its results are brilliantly paraded before society therefore the successful alchemists of the olden time were said to live so plainly and to go in disguise dodging about the world as did thomas vaughan to escape observation and as even they found it a fearful task it may be supposed that miss rockhard who had a ten times harder secret to keep than theirs with not onetenth part of their sense or experience to keep it on began to wonder anon whether she had not spoken overhastily when she commended her own powers of discretion as a subject not open to discussion ‘the female sex’ writes flaxius in his great analysis ‘differs from the male mostly in this that it never takes naturally or instinctively to rum or tobacco neither does it ever feel conscience or remorse fear of discovery it does indeed experience and very sincere regret or sorrow at incurring punishment but whether any one woman since eve ever regretted anything on principle or per se is as yet among the unfoundouts ‘wherein i discover’ he observes ‘a great and wise provision of nature for when we consider what a vast quantity there is of confused conscience and misplaced remorse in man we cannot be too thankful that woman is not afflicted with the same calamity it being very evident that if she were humanity must needs take a fresh start on new principles therefore do i opine’ he adds ‘that “things” as germans call the evolution of humanity are going on best as they are although i did have a tin of spoiled caviare brought to me this morning for breakfast’ as regards the dress and jewellery of miss rockhard it was a completeor as the french say an insanesuccess her friends and the public admired it with an envy which as she often perceived amounted to agony and there were peeresses who suffered the tortures of the damned and with them millionairesses who panted like harts for the waterbrook with desire to learn the secret of those transcendental toilets which was all like nectar and ambrosia to her small soul and as she had the thin good sense and cautious taste to rarely use expensive fabrics and was very chary with diamonds and the like and being clever soon acquired a stock of evasive phrases and satirical retorts for the most direct questions she might have long escaped detection the first error which she committed was the very common one for all her kind of ingratitude for as regarded flaxius the very fact of her success irritated her when she reflected that he had entirely established all his assertions and completely got the better of herafter all her assumption of superior intelligenceand as she recalled him every time she donned a dress with renewed vexation the feeling grew in time to tormenting hatred there being no vindictiveness like that for benefits received nor was she any better disposed towards the fairy since every time she was teased by questioners she said to herself ‘pest take the creature why couldn’t she just as well have given me the clothes without any condition ’tis ever the way with these mysterious snobs they always do everything by halves in a petty way so as to render gratitude impossible i believe that vulgar teasing is a part of their low nature’ now when the moral obligation to keep a secret is gone and the buttresses are so to speak knocked away it generally requires but a little push to overthrow the whole building and this push came ere long from an unexpected quarter miss jesabelle rockhard was born and lived in undeniably good society but had never had more than very scanty sniffs of ‘the purer atmosphere of dukedom’ as the melancholy jacques with refined wit remarks even the word is ‘a spell to call fools together’ albeit printers have spoiled his spelling now it befell that a duchess of twentyfour carats a dame of irrepressible power stronger at every point than poor miss jesabelle and one whose flamberg or sixfeet twohanded sword was not to be lightly turned by the latter’s fencing foilfenced she never so wiselyhad set her whole soul on learning the secret of the exquisite toilets hitherto miss rockhard had only gentler breezes to resist but now there was a cyclone brewing before which had she been wise she would have fled unto the uttermost parts of the earth the duchess soon learnedindeed ’twas common talkthat the now famous miss rockhard guarded with great care the secret of her dresses she made adroit special longcontinued inquirywho would not be detective for a duchessand the more she was confirmed in the report the more obstinately was she determined to penetrate the mystery ‘o thou poor jesabelle’ writes flaxius ‘whom i did greatly love with all thy faultssince devil a one was there of them thine ownall being drawn from good societyhow gladly would i have averted from thee the fate which i saw gathering over thy graceful head how gladly would i have clucked unto thee as the cock clucketh unto the hen to come to him when he has found a grain albeit he often swallows it ere she gets thereor done anything in reason to paratonnerre away the crash and flash in the dark gathering cloudit could not be all that we could do was to await the explosion pick up the pieces glue them together as well as possible and so en avant ‘it is written in the babylonian chronicle of the great rabbi ganef ben nofgur that “even as a monkey will in doing mischief manifest as much mind as would make him the equal of man so a woman to find out a secret which is none of her business will show the genius of seven devils for ten measures of intermeddling were sent down by aschmodai upon earth and the daughters of israel got nine of them”’ from which ye may understand that the duchess finding that the treasure was deeply buried and craftily enchanted took great precaution and pains to disinter it firstly she was merely affable to miss rockhard in the winsome way which shows that any one has taken a special an unconscious likingwhich is a particular form of humbug treated more fully by patrick mac iavel in his treatise on the art of blarneying she set on to jesabelle an artless niece who jesabelle thought was a fool and who ended by fooling hermiss rockhardcompletely then the duchess began a series of fondlings pettings little intimacies and careful confidences invitations to dinner and the operasending her carriage freely for her on all occasions in a word she wound round the victim such an insidious mesh of obligations that at last she judged that the roast was done to a turn and ready to be served carved and eaten so one night at a reception at the ducal palace to which jesabelle had come in consequence of most ingenious and urgent desirein the utmost magnificence which she daredher jewellery on this occasion being rather seriously splendid and dangerousthe hostess struck her coup by displaying the most passionate admiration of her guest’s attire then with great adroitness she led the conversation to the fondness she had for jesabelle which subtly trained towards the obligations and kindnesses which had by this time run up to an alarming sum and then suddenly recurring to the dress she said ‘if you are indeed as you say deeply grateful to me for anything and are sincere as i am in friendship my dear then acquit it all by a mere trifle and tell me truly without any equivocation the secret of your marvellous dresses’ miss rockhard would very much have preferred seeing an insane anarchist flourishing a bomb and a carvingknife come dancing into her drawingroom to this simple question from her dearest friend and the agitation of her features showed italmost fearfully the duchess was delighted ‘now for an adroit coup’ she thought ‘and i have it’ ‘i dare say my dear’ she added with sweet persuasion ‘that there is really no great mystery in it after all you girls are so fond of making up romances perhaps i can even aid you with it if perfect secrecy experience and love can aid but it will not be confiding a secret you know for we two are one and ’twill be as if you told it to yourself’ when one feels a secret like an intolerable burden or a pack of coals on one’s backheavy as sin and burning as remorsethe bearer catches at any excuse for betraying it nor was jesabelle a little piqued by the artful hint ‘i dare say there is really no great mystery in it after all’ and perhaps the duchess with her vast knowledge of life and invincible prestige could solve the mystery so that no harm or loss could come of it and driven to the wall as she was and at her wits’ end for a rupture with her grace meant social ruin she actually caught at the last straw‘it will not be telling a secret since we are one’as if it had been a rope thrown by a lifebuoyant philanthropist ‘you will not say’ remarked the duchess somewhat sarcastically ‘that it is a fairygift’ at that word jesabelle in despair and anger exclaimed’twas as if the very devil spoke for her and used her tongue ‘it is a fairy gift’ the duchess uttered an appalled scream there was a chorus of ‘ha’sho’soh dear me’s’ through all the gamut heard from those aroundtableau ‘what is the matter’ cried jesabelle terrified ‘look in the glass’ cried the duchess pointing to a twentyfoot mirror opposite miss rockhard looked and saw an awful sight it was herself arrayed in nothing but her undergarments with a wisp of straw on her wrist a piece of clothesline rope about her head and on her bosom a great threepenny brass and glass brooch and amid her surroundings this costume looked ten times worse than it had done in devonshire street ‘a lunatic a mad woman wonder how she got in hope she won’t attack us wonder if she’s got a pistol we shall all be killed run for the police’ was heard on all sides miss rockhard fainted some mysterious friendshe knew not whostepped forward wrapped her in a cloak and conveyed her in a carriage to her home yet heavily as the blow fell on her it struck the duchess at once almost as severely for after all her pains and after driving poor jesabelle to the wall and to insanity all that she had got was ‘it is a fairygift’ at which even a child would laugh she might well have exclaimed ‘i have brought my pig to a fine market to be sure’ as the princess iona mic flanagan remarked after she had driven a swine from dublin to cork where it was eaten by a wolf the incident was sung in tara’s psaltery and recorded in the leabhair ruad or redbook of the nine masters in shelta when jesabelle came to herself in the morning a brief halfhour of deadly sickening despair was succeeded by a good healthy reaction of rage at the duchess the fairy flaxius and all mankind even as the hero hans breitmann ungratefully wished that his teacher professor schmitzerl ‘vas in hell’ for teaching him how to ride on a bicycle did miss rockhard wish that all those whose favours gifts and applause she had once so anxiously sought were all at the bottom of inferno and the devil dancing on them because they had given her in fullest measure what she most ardently desired yea perjured herself to obtain i have here arrived o lector benevole thou best of readers at what is to us i trust the most interesting point that is to say the crisis in this eventful history it happened once during the american war that after the confederates had been defeated in a battle certain gallant southern ‘chivs’ or chivalric officers attempted to account for the failure one attributing it to a sudden rise in the river and another to a division not coming up in time till at last one startled them all by asking ‘if they didn’t think the yankees had something to do with it’ even so after making out that everybody had been against her and shown themselves a pack of contemptible wretches did it occur to miss rockhard that she herself had counted for something in the game and had something to do with it and being now as it were thrown into solitude and having a fine vigorous mind and being withdrawn from the society which had so fearfully warped it she began so to speak to straighten out again morally and recuperate she felt no remorse at all but she began to study that which had made her err a society with its ideals of the most adroit slander knowledge of all that is none of our business ostentation wealth rank and birth though ever so evilly sustained or disgraced or dishonoured the adroitness of shallow sarcasm and silly flippancy and the real meaning of vogue and fashion and finally the awkward blundering manner in which even these wretched fancies were carried out by ninetenths of their devotees real and accomplished men and women of the worldthe true article being a great rarity even in belgravia her selfexamination was long and searching sparing herself no pang being as pitiless to the me as to the them having no other on whom to exercise her sarcasms she turned them all on her own folliesnot raving in despair and calling herself a fool but as she indeed always did finding out what was in the object thus illuminated and shown up and it did her an immense amount of good she had an awful crust of old dead shells and a fearful lot of foul seaweed to scrape away from the ship ere it would sail well but she did it for to do jesabelle rockhard justice she had pluck and bottom grit and endurance and was not the kind of girl to throw up the game of life because she had lost a fairy wardrobe or even the favour of a duchess and not being french but right valiant english of good fighting stock she resolved to show fight and put a good face on a bad game all at once it occurred to her that the long and earnest reflection which she had given to herself and to society had developed the serious and sustained analysis of character which forms the real power of the novelist and that which elevates him above the storyteller she was seated at brighton in the shingle on a fine day at noon under an umbrella when it came into her mind that as a novelist she could enter on a new life it was like a great revelation for with her clear vigorous wellinformed mind she grasped all the possibilities of such a career and its tremendous power once in history when women came acropper in any earthly way they went into a convent now they go into a publisher’sthat is to say they write or rewrite a novel all geniuses are whitewashed a woman of genius may pawn her reputation when an obscurity dare not look over the fence make yourself a celebrity and society will do the rest ninetenths of notoriety consists not of what people know but what they say about anybody if you have sinned there are two ways to be forgiven either repent your evil deeds or describe those of others the most certain way to make two thousand a year by writing novels is to tell all your friends in confidence that you earn one thousand understandest thou thisor what a gypsy woman of her acquaintance from whom she bought bouquets and whose shrewd observations had often amused her came up and gave her what is called in tramp slang a lyover in romany a ruzhia and in english a flower ‘tell me amalthea cooper’ she inquired ‘what do you understand by society give me a sixpence worth of information’ ‘when any kind of a lot of people gets together anyhow’ replied amalthea after a grave pause ‘it’s a mob when there’s amany that generally assembles such as three or four tans or families it’s what we calls in our language the sweti or our world but when they are of the same kind of folk and are invited to a drop of tea or beer or to have something and a talkand one may be plays a tune on a fiddlewhy that’s society’ ‘and what do they talk about’ inquired jesabelle ‘well’ answered the gypsy with a smile ‘mostly about how one has been sent to staripen or prison for stealin’and what a fool he was to let himself be tookand how other folks has run off with one another wives and the like ummoralitys and how some larrups their romis or morts which is wives and missuses and all such little rakapen or gossipand that’s what i calls society’ ‘c’est tout comme chez nous’ remarked miss rockhard ‘here is your sixpence amalthea decidedly i will take to novelling’ it was a magnificent success as great as the toilets had been and to miss jesabelle in her new mind infinitely more gratifying she didn’t deserve it good people may say but somehow jesabelle did write brilliant books and rose to the top of the wave even the incident of the evening at the duchess’s was now narrated as an eccentricity of genius and when it was mentioned men in the clubs said ‘ah my dear fellow excuse me you haven’t got the right rendering of that story’ finally it settled into two versions one of the sporting world which found its way into the blue ‘un that ‘jes’ had done it for a wager which was in a way true and the other more humane legend that it was at the request of the duchess who had begged her to sing the ‘lunatic barmaid’ in character and her novels were stinging i warrant you as she became amiable personally she grew savage in literature she gave it to society and fashion à la aquafortis and as society did not see itself but only its friends in her scathing speeches it was perfectly delighted she did not touch lightly and gently and pityingly as i have done on its poor little imperfections she ripped them up as with a scalper in the hands of a red indian or a familiar tormentor of the inquisition at a five o’clock tea i never could learn that it did any good for even the victims felt pride at being shown up in good company as worthy of note but her books sold and she was famous ‘heaven help their souls they’d rather be’ et cetera it was more than a year after the events here narrated had taken place and miss rockhard had greatly improved on her celebrity by a ‘stunning second’ or another novel that she found herself again at brighton seated as before under a white umbrella she was reading proofs which is of itself a bliss to a young writer as strong minds as hers love to speak of ‘my publisher’ and this was mingled with a mild vague impression of children digging with wooden spades negro minstrels balladsingers flowergirls bathingmachines the flow of a thousand voices the broadspreading blue ocean and ships far off and out at sea with the sun upon their sails when lifting her eyes they encountered the gaze of another pair which for an instant half prolonged her dreamy mood in dim conjecture till she recognised in the other the somewhat remarkable character who had indirectly had such a wondrous influence on her fate it was indeed the great and wise flaxius in propria persona who had taken unto himself a pennyworth of chair at a little distance which distance he promptly proceeded to diminish when he perceived that the lady had not forgotten him ‘it is a long time since we first met’ said miss rockhard ‘nearly two years’ ‘nearly two thousand years’ replied flaxius in a strangely solemn voice wie glocketon und orgelklang ‘yes quite two thousand though learned critics of the kethubim differ as to the date and jochanan and ben hillel thinkbut never mind ’tis so’ ‘and who was i then’ inquired miss rockhard entering as she thought into the spirit of one of flaxius’s strange jests ‘truly a femme incomprise and one who died in fact misunderstood just as you might have done had you made your exit some two years ago since at that time you did not really understand yourself’ ‘i think’ replied the dear young lady ‘that is strictly true of the whole silly sisterhood’ she said it with a deep blush though not a blusher in a general way for she recalled the last interview much in sorrow not at all in wrath ‘but who was i two millennia gone by’ ‘the wife of king ahab of the jews the very much distinguished jezebel’ truly this was a shake for miss rockhard and the blush came up as a flush somewhat heightened yet she said with a smile ‘i regret that you only remember me as the greatest iniquity of the old testament i am curious to know if you admired me very much in that character’ ‘not in that character but in your true one which i declare sincerely and without paradox has been most cruelly misrepresented’ ‘as it is a personal matter’ rejoined miss rockhard ‘i need not say that i am all expectancy and attention’ ‘very well who is it that describes jezebel for us a personal enemy of extreme bitterness and one of a race approving death and murder in any form when any one of the goyim or gentiles is concerned’ ‘i never thought of that’ said jesabelle reflectively ‘and religious antipathy must have been stronger among the hebrews than in any other race for they were strongminded’ ‘yes’ replied flaxius ‘it is too generally lost sight of in church histories that those who make the best martyrs are also best martyring others but to return to jezebel the first and chief crime with which she is charged is remaining steadfast to that polytheistic syrian religion in which she was brought up and to which she was in duty bound to be attached since her father was king of zidon and in a sense its head the king of the jews married her and was fascinated by the charms of that splendid and sensual system which seemed so attractive compared to the grim hebrew ascetic monotheism which gave no joyousness to this life neither did it promise a future as did the syrian so that it came to pass that the greatest and wisest men among the hebrews often adopted it and it more than once happened that nearly all israel went over to it ‘now bear in mind my friend’ said flaxius with a smile ‘that in reading the book of kings we generally go as in a torrent of headlong agreement with the writer who assumes as a matter of course that everybody who is not a hebrew monotheist and an implicit believer in all that the prophets are said to have said and all that is told about them is utterly wicked beyond all sinners and deserving death’ ‘that is true’ assented miss rockhard ‘the prophet whom jezebel threatened in a rage because he had put to death the priests of her own religion who were probably her intimate friends and relations is elijaheliawho with the masculine termination appears in greek as helios the sun who like the latter goes up to or over the heaven in a chariot of fire after performing the preliminary mosesmiracle of dividing the water of a stream i think that we may set aside jezebel’s sins as regarded this very mythical character as dubiously inconsiderable and when we reflect that the hebrews slew one hundred thousand syrians in one day as we read in the twentyninth verse of the twentieth chapter of kings simply for differences of religious opinion the whole war being stimulated by prophets and priests the slaughter of a few prophets ascribed to jezebel may well pass as an incident of war these great bands of one hundred and fifty prophets seem to have been identical with the roaming darweesh of the arabs whose business it is to stir up war we are accustomed to feel awe at the prophets because they usually appear singly in their majesty like god but these bands of one hundred and fifty all prophesying en masse rather detract from the dignity of the profession ‘now as regards naboth’s vineyard it was unquestionably a wicked deed ahab had offered naboth the jezreelite a better vineyard for his own or its worth in money and ahab was the king the refusal was a bitter blow before all the world so bitter that the king became ill and seemed to be dying because he had been as he conceived insulted ‘now there is no proof that jezebel cared twopence for the vineyard but she was passionately fond of her family and husband she had been born and brought up to familiarity with excess of bloodshed for trifles she had seen all the priests whom she revered and one hundred thousand of her own people killed for adhering to their own religion and as she preferred the life of ahab to that of naboth and being an unquestionably clever and vigorous woman she easily contrived to have the latter put out of the way one evil deed does not excuse another but it is worth observing that pious king david was guilty of a very similar but far viler and more nefarious transaction as regarded uriah’s wife for which he was indeed only vicariously punished while jezebel was made to suffer not only by loss of husband and son but most cruelly in person ‘now we come to the end of the tragedy jehu after having murdered jehoram in a cowardly and treacherous manner returned to jerusalem and here the narrator by a most ingenious little touch of art has contrived to say something of jezebel which has done more to make her appear infamous by her biographer than every thing else accusativeif indeed he meant itwhich may be doubtful it is the simple statement that “when jehu was come to jezreel jezebel heard of it and she painted her face and tired her head and looked out at a window” from which has come the popular saying of “painted jezebels” suggesting vile women covered with rouge’ ‘and even rouge is not quite a sin if it be god help belgravia’ remarked miss rockhard ‘and yet she was not even rouged’ added flaxius for the hebrew original says “put her eyes in painting” which means that she drew lines with kohl or antimony powder under her eyelashes as was the usual custom with all women good or bad all over the east where it is common to this day it amounted to no more than putting on a bonnet or drawing on a pair of gloves as for “tiring her head”’ added flaxius solemnly and almost sadly ‘when i think how isaiah and jeremiah must have tired the heads and hearts of all israel with their lamentations i can pass over jezebel’s work it was her own business ‘and when the brutal and cowardly assassin jehu entered she addressed him as only an injured wife and mother and a woman of marvellous wit and deep feeling could have done with the cleverest keenest and most succinct sarcasm or reproach ever uttered it was simply “had zimri peace who slew his master” few at the present day realise how stinging this question was to an extremely superstitious and brutal man like jehu fearful of omens and uneasy as to the crimes of regicide it was maddening but the woman never existed who wouldn’t have said it if she could have thought of it’ ‘i am sure that i should under the circumstances’ replied the young lady ‘though i knew that all the vengeance in the hand of man was to follow’ ‘so she was thrown out of the window and jehu killed her stamping the bruised woman under his own feet in his frenzied rage so that as it is written “some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses” showing how high it must have jetted up and how savagely she was trampled on by the infuriated jew ‘even the eating of jezebel by dogs is told in such a manner as to convey an impression of infamy and guilt on her part but if jehu or any other jew or gentile or anything eatable were thrown to the dogs in jerusalem today they would soon finish it when the soul is gone it matters little how the poor shell of humanity is treated but i find something very degrading and disgraceful in the manner in which the writer dwells upon and exults in the fact that the ‘carcase’ of jezebel was insulted and that dogs ate her flesh it would have been more creditable to elijah and to all concerned if they had given her burial as became a king’s daughter for she was queenly and showed no fear in her last moment and when she knew that death was at hand she calmly made her toilet as a lady would to appear well like queen catherine to the last and greeted her foe with a richly deserved reproof and not with prayers for mercy yes she died like one of royal race’ ‘mr flaxius’ said miss jesabelle ‘do you know that if i should ever come into court as defendant in anything from pitch and toss up to murder anarchy or high treason i should like to have you for my counsel i believe that you would make me out an angel even to my own conviction’ ‘the usual formula of polite society would be’ replied flaxius ‘to say that i have always been convinced myself of the fact but as i have not and would be very much puzzled to know how to dispose of any such feathered anomaly all i can say is that if you were no more guilty than i believe jezebel to have been i would accept the case with alacrity and clear you if there be such a thing as justice in the land’ ‘since you have defended jezebel so well’ replied the lady ‘perhaps you could say a word for herodias i always understood that the advocatus diaboli was the prosecuting attorney but in this case he appears for the defence’ ‘herodias’ said the sage ‘was a bird of a very different colour but like all the rest she was a femme incomprise and to begin with the original of the name who is to this very day recognised among the older witches in italy as their queen jointly with diana was of remote oriental origin or the same as lilith of the jews she was eminently the fair demon of fascination who was “simply killing” and you must bear it in mind that something of all this devilry was in the mind of the good christians who wrote about the lady of the new testament who danced herod off his head and the head off saint john and the original herodias was as certainly the goddess of dancing which was a serious and terrible means of bewitchment in the olden time11 ‘in regard to the transaction described in the later scripture it is marvellous that no writer has ever treated it from a modernsociety christian fiveo’clocktea practical point of view suppose a ladyan intelligent accomplished widow who has had a pleasant life as wife of the governor of paryobberee or cathay the governor dies his brother succeeds to the appointment and marries the widow as was strictly commanded in the old testament from which book sundry moderns derive the command that a man is not to marry his wife’s sister’ ‘consistency thou art a jewel’ interpolated miss rockhard ‘well he marries the widow or it may be the fraternal divorced wife then uprises a clergyman of a new sect with what were considered eccentric new views who has tremendous influence among the people and informs the governor that his marriage is illegal and then fancy the feelings of herodias on one hand divorce and perhaps death or poverty with a charming daughter just coming out on the other a prophet of the wildest description and it was considered to be such a remarkably natural trifling and commonplace thing in those days to put anybody to death who was in your way if you had the power to do it just as good john calvin did with servetus when the latter got in his way or as some millions of heretics were disposed of mostly with antecedent torture by “meek merciful allchristlike mother church” and so herodias did what the grand majority of worldlyminded high or low church christian matrons and mammas would do today under the same circumstancesif they couldand put saint john out of the way ‘this is the legend of herodias’ there was a long silence when flaxius said ‘now tell me if under the same conditions of secrecy as before and with all your recent experience and newly acquired wisdom would you accept the marvellous wardrobe of the fairy alban once more for if you will take it you shall have it forthwith’ miss rockhard had for months reflected on and studied this very question to its very lees but she took a minutetwo minutesto her reply and when she spoke it was with emotion close to tears but with firm voice ‘oh i thank you from my very heart for i feel deeply that this offer now is a thousand times kinder than was the first but i have had my lesson and i hope i do not need anotherwhen i do you will i hope’here she looked up with a sad sweet smile ‘she is immensely prettier than she used to be’ thought flaxius ‘you will i hope not spare me but as for the wardrobe it is best where it isin fairy hands nor would i know anything more of magic or occulta or mysteries for i have learned what few know that no human nature unless perhaps it be gifted as few are and has had years of training can keep or is fit to know such secrets it will be time to attend to them when we shall have exhausted science’ ‘yes’ replied flaxius ‘when you exhaust science a little more you will indeed find that magic is beginning in earnest’ ‘and so’ added jesabelle with a smile as they rose to departi dare say it was in the direction of mutton’s to lunch‘we learn from past trials and bitter storms how in future to keep under shelter and seek only the sunny way ‘“for all experience is an arch where through gleams that untravelled world whose margin fades for ever and for ever as we roam”’ haec fabula docet ‘ye morale of whych lytil historie’ pens flaxius as usual on the galley ‘is that we should firstly not believe the worst of anybody be it derived from their own manner and demeanour or from oral or written report and above all have patience with them and try to help them to a better state for verily this miss rockhard was a hard nut to crack and enough to daunt the devil or any decent man as i first met her and a hard time i had with her yet did she come out ‘all right as a trivet’ a trivet being as ye know dearly beloved a tripod and the reference ‘all right’ to the infallible accuracy of the delphic oracle which is however a fact not generally known for of all things a threelegged stool stands most securely as for the manner in which any evil report may be cruelly and undeservedly attached to a name there is still a word to be said for belle jezebel of hebrew history when i of late defended her character i was rebuffed with the remark that there was in the book of kings a distinct assertion that she was aahemsocial eviland a witch this being the speech of jehu kings ii 9 v 22 now be it observed that the expression here employed is to be found over and over again in the old testament and in almost every instance is used not to signify any adultery or individual immorality but to discredit the syrian religion it was a very nasty and unmanly form of abuse which the hebrew prophets and saint john used far too freely on all occasions to characterise everything theological which displeased them just as sailors and the like use ‘bloody’ et cetera very often with no meaning whatever or as the gentlemen and ladies of houndsditch cry out noffgur and bennoffgur and so forth far too freely to all offenders this speech of jehu’s was it is true used not in the pickwickian sense but most certainly in the theological which is the next thing to it for the first impulse of the odium theologicum is to be ‘nasty’ now a good tough nature like jesabelle’s when really honest is all the better and cleaner for a good mangling as was beautifully expressed by the ancients as follows illustration that is three v’s meaning virtus virtute virescit virtue flourishes by virtue signifying that like the chamomile it grows the more for being trampled on to the present day this sign is often to be seen on the walls of florence scratched in chalk or charcoal and prefixed to the names of popular favourites it is generally believed to be a monogram of evviva 10 vide etruscanroman remains by charles godfrey leland london fisher unwin 11 here the chronicler of flaxius would fain get in a little réclame by mentioning that herodias and diana have a small book to themselves in aradia or the gospel of the witches by charles godfrey leland london d nutt how flaxius sat as judge with a jury of twelve devils ‘sono demoni chi rappresentano il popolaccio del inferno mentre che i diavoli ne sono i principi e i gran signori’ ‘there are demons who represent the populace of hell while the devils are its nobility and great gentlemen and some of these have left a name such as it is in books on strange subjectsdel diavolo a treatise 1870 the sun had drowned himself in the sea and his widow the sky after dissipating the evening gold which he had left was contracting a second marriage with night who brought her as settlement the silver moon and the whole heavenly sack of stars when flaxius wandered along alone by the wild wailing waves seeing smelling tasting feeling and hearing the sweetsalt vapoury ocean breeze so he went onit was a lonely coasttill he encountered a shepherd established in a hut of stones and turf a tenement so small as to bear to its inhabitant the relation a shell bears to a tortoise ‘is there any place hereabout’ asked flaxius ‘where i could lodge for the night’ ‘none for near a five mile’ answered the herd removing the slender pipe of clay from his lips ‘leastwise none where yer could get hin that is ’cept the devil’s den a hold ouse furder on and there’ he added emphatically ‘i reckon yer’d only be too glad to get hout’ ‘why’ inquired flaxius ‘’cos it’s ruinedwuss than jane shoree hever wus by the royal reprobate’ replied the herd who appeared to have some tincture of letters ‘is it roofed’ ‘roofed and waterproofed’ was the reply ‘’taint there that the affliction commences i mean ruined in reppertation and

look and a small silver coin the herd replied with a sixpenceive smile of gratitude ‘sir’ he exclaimed ‘“you are a good lot” as the lady said to her ’usband before she turned to a piller hof salt’ ‘how can i be a lot being but one’ inquired flaxius ‘hi call a cove good compeny when a penny come to me from ’im’ replied the shepherd ‘you stand six hof ’em you’re more’n a cove you’re a whole covey hof birds a multitood o’ virtues a ‘arf dozener’ the sage went on from pile to pile of pebbles or earth marked with whitewash to serve the coastguards as guides in darkness till he beheld before him the shelter which he sought it was a dilapidated stone house of the jacobean time and style not unpicturesque gracefully draped with ivy and as it stood in the light of a full moon on a rising rocky platform with a seaview circling round there was in it something which irresistibly recalled scenes in theatres and novels smugglers witches guy mannering and anne the uncanny of geierstein but what gave it specially this appearance to flaxius was the gleam from within of a light which he knew at once was lit by no mortal match and fed by no earthly oil or fuel it rose and fell quivering and thrilling like a northern light sometimes causing the building to appear as if in flame and then shrinking to an arrowy ray or a mere needle changing to many hues in which however a sulphur blue ever predominated and with its changes there rang in time and measure high or low unearthly laughter strange shouts or ululations sinking to stranger humming or buzzing and passing to a dreamy melody in softened shade all at once broken up by a startling blare and flare and wild vociferation in strange tongues it required little reflection for the magian to conjecture the nature of the company from whom such sounds proceeded nor was he astonished after opening the door entering the hall and uttering the wizard greeting which proclaimed his nature to see the sight which met his eyes round about a great block of sandstone which served for a table and on which stood two open cases of gin several loose bottles a tengallon demijohn of whisky a raisin box full of perique or favori du diable tobacco and an ancient muchthumbed manuscript bound in sheetiron sat lolling and sprawling in all the extravagance of unconventional ease on divans or seats also of stone twelve demons or spirits of that kind whose mission it is in life to busy themselves especially with all that is mischievous reckless stirring wild eccentric or subversive that is to say they are always occupied with what they call ‘whooping it up’ aiding and encouraging youth to paint towns red inspiring celtic politics whether french or irish organising riots editing society newspapers evoking up divorces anarchising and filling police courts with cases they were all smoking and drinking and seemed to be earnestly occupied with some extremely interesting subject of debate the intensity or moderation of which was manifested in the crescendo or diminuendo of a flame rising from a great terracotta vase and by the tones of their voices ‘hallo old flax is that you’ cried the only one of this precious company with whom the sage had ever before made acquaintance this was slangnot by any means the worst of them since his mission merely was to corrupt language and invent all kinds of new grotesque forms of speech ‘mozeltoff luck to you old cove sās tute a kairin tiro kokero’ he continued in the tongue generally spoken among devils and goblins ‘how have you been doing since they let you out’ ‘kūshti adosta well enough’ replied flaxius in the same tone and tongue for there never was man on earth who could so adapt himself gracefully to the most varied society or ‘all shorts and editions’ of life ‘may i venture to ask for what purpose you gentlemen are here assembled’ ‘lel a swägler an’ a cutter a mūltattopani take a pipe and a drop of brandy before we get to biz’ exclaimed slang dusting a seat obsequiously as he spoke and indeed it was quite evident despite their swaggering impudence and their feet on the tables that the whole party of demons were deeply sensible of the honour of entertaining such a distinguished guest flaxius accepted the refreshment and sat down ‘what you behold’ said moloch the diavolo of pessimism ‘is a sad spectacle and a melancholy instance of diabolical deterioration showing how even natures which have received every blessing of hell and all infernal advantages from the devil himself can become depraved to mere inertia we are now a jury here assembled to try one of our number for his reputation you sir though happily exempted from all such mutations are aware that the limit of moral existence is one thousand years for a member of our order unless he by progressive energy or genius advances himself in which case he receives a renewal of his social lease now there is one of our number known as sneak who during all his snivelling millennium has never got beyond where he begunor vulgarity and idle follyincluding carrying and retailing petty gossip teaching foolish old clubmen and ladies how to twaddle about divorces and marriages elopements and relationships gleaning trash and mean slander from low servants and sticking just there such an existence we hold is too contemptible for even the meanest devil in inferno hence this jury to decide whether the creature shall exist among us any longer and as our judge has failed to put in an appearance we respectfully request your wisdom to take his place as referee’ ‘i consent with pleasure’ said flaxius ‘produce the culprit’ a truculentlooking demon named dobble whose department was quarrelling the prizering rencounters and rows here arose went to a corner put a box under his arm brought it to the table opened it and took from it a form pressed flat like a pair of trousers in a trunk this he unfoldedblew it up like a bladder by means of the stem of his claypipeand gave it a drink of whisky when lo the form assumed some semblance of if not humanity at least demonity it was a wretchedlooking phantom something in it recalling a battered punch or tattered ally sloper a paul pry a thing without a conscience or moral sense yet not without prying inquisitiveness or petty cunninga poor simulacrum of a popular paltry jest it sat up and grinned and leered without a trace of fear as ifall its function finishedit had nothing else to do but to die game as vulgar secondhand tradition enjoined its kind to do ‘i appear here’ said moloch not without dignity ‘as advocatus diaboli or public prosecutor the entire life and actions of this sneak whom i will not honour with the name of devil or even imp are so well known to all here present as to render a formal indictment a work of supererogation yet that all due formalities may be properly fulfilled i ask the accused if he demands that any accusation be made’ to which the culprit replied by casting up his head and saying in a tone which would have elicited roars of applause in a music hall ‘yaap who’re you shut up’ ‘an indictment is therefore needless let me here remark gentlemen’ said moloch with great impressiveness ‘that though we may all be demons and even the humblest of our order our mission is not as is vulgarly supposed to do evil it is simply agitation and action’ ‘to keep things abilin’’ interposed slang ‘quite true the honourable gentleman who has just interrupted me is for example often accused of mere vulgarity but unjustly he may be a rude poet but he invents new similes and vigorous racy words which are often wanting i myselfin many waysby introducing pessimism to society and by raising the question as to whether life is worth living caused a discussion which rendered me worthy of receiving a renewal of my lease of life the pugnacity of my colleague dobble has its silver liningit provokes resistance argument and conclusion we may all be a rough lot with a hard bark but there is wood in us but the accused is all rotten bark and no bite and hollow vulgarity twaddle gossip and smalltalk are all one and the same thing and the mind devoted to them alone stagnates and putrefies the spirit of it dies very slowly gentlemen but if nothing better can be said of this fin de siècle it must be at least admitted that this century has witnessed no advance in vulgarity and the pettiness which kills for everything gentlemen i await your verdict’ ‘guilty in large capitals’ cried slang who seemed to be foreman ‘we’re all agreed like a rope of inyons’ ‘prisoner’ exclaimed flaxius ‘have you anything to say why sentence of nonrenewal of existence should not be passed on you’ ‘oh a’nt i just’ screamed sneak in a punch tone ‘call me vulgar do yer yer vaggabonesme that moves in the highest circles among the biggest suckers listen to this’ and with that he drew from his pocket a fashionable weekly newspaper well known on every stand and proceeded to read from it such a mass of drivelling silliness relating to the pettiest acts or tastes of the upper classes including that of royalty itself and all that constituted what it regarded as ‘society’ that even flaxius was fain to drink another glass of brandy and light a cigar to enable him to sustain the infliction at last it came to an end ‘there’ exclaimed sneak triumphantly ‘that’s what erbamala the great noveliste and i call human nature the best art is the depicting thatit pays bestand i’m the spirit who inspires it all there i rest my defence’ ‘the defence’ said flaxius ‘has aggravated the offence’ ‘well my time is not out and you’ll find that i shall drag on awhile longer’ ‘true’ observed flaxius ‘but observe that there was a time when you had a place such as it was among those who are here present now it is lost even the demons of the present day disown you therefore i pronounce you dead de facto for those for whom you now live among mortals have no intellects begone’ the foreman opened a window and the living dead whisked out of it like a great carrion bluebottle with a buzz ‘did the deceased leave any property on which to administer’ asked boodle the modern incarnation of mammon ‘yes he left me’ piped a small voice and a sharp little imp two inches in height sprang on the table ‘i’m puttuli’ ‘immortalised by musæus’ said moloch ‘you were used to go about to people’s pockets and report what you found therein to your master’ ‘yes but i can do more than that’ replied puttuli ‘i can observe and report anything’ ‘well none of us want you’ cried slang ‘you little sneaking spying villain so be off with you by the first boatquicker than immediately if not sooner’ ‘nay’ said flaxius ‘he may be useful if properly employed with your permission gentlemen i will take him’ and as there was no dissenting voice the wise flaxius departed with puttuli in his pocket and he soon found that he had indeed a pocketcompanion and volubleif not valuablevademecum for the diminutive imp was what a distinguished american writer calls an ‘amoosin’ little cuss’ and ‘especially good at beguiling off the odd corners of the weary hours’ ‘haec fabula docet’ wrote flaxius ‘or its moral isnot what too many satirists so sadly wailthat sneak actually represents the spirit of this bottom of the century but its very dregs which are however stirred up too much by the spoons of small writers into what would be but for them a clear exhilarating beverage the very devils whose agitation in a certain way leads ever to something that is good find their work hindered by this imp of pettiness prosperity and peace or its stagnation engender the birth of such mosquitoes a roaring torrent of even dirty water is better for it will wash itself clean ere long but a standing pool only creates vile insects and malaria flaxius and the bookseller ‘“l’amour des livres est plus utile que vous ne croyez” dit le capitaine “car je trouve dans mes études un calme qui vous manque vous ne soupçonnez pas tout ce qu’une manie a de précieux docteur elle occupe comme une passion et n’a aucun de ses tourments croyezmoi puisque la vie n’est après tout qu’une

a sea with monsters filled devouring making love or raging wild full many a heart is like that water drop’ the day had been grim and illtemperedflitting fitfully through all the phases of bad weatherpromising at times like a deceitful child to be good when it would clear a little into curling mists through which there came a doubtful ray of lightwhen straight anon there fell a dismal fog then wild rain maddened by the roaring of the windfor ’tis terrible mourning when any one cries aloud and weeps at the same timelaut aufweinendas the germans say oh i warrant you that the rusty weathercocks as they whirled round and round and screamed as if crowing to the wilde jäger in the old town of nuremberg and the wind lowwaving like the deep baying of his hounds made a fine witches’chorus that nightyea the very gutters in their unwonted joy at becoming bounding brooks sang gurgling songs as they hurried along to leap into the pegnitz ‘’tis a sauwetteryea a hundeswettera swine and dog weather’ exclaimed the little old man to flaxius as the latter refuged himself just long enough to turn his umbrella which had been reversed into a great goblet by a sudden squall under an arch this arch was over the projecting doorway of a shop ’twas immensely massive from the old bold time and i warrant you that albert dürer and willibald pirckheimer and hans sachs and all of ’em had passed under it often ‘i could make better weather’ added the old man ‘with only a rusty teakettle and a pint of’ flaxius looked up there was a little halfobliterated sign over the ancient door which had once proclaimed to the world that here was a buchhandlung or bookshop but like an ancient warrior with stress of time and battling with the elements it had forgotten most of its letters ‘you sell books’ replied flaxius ‘how do you know that’ asked the little man with a quick suspicious glance as if a secret which he wished to keep hidden had been revealed ‘and you have for sale a fine copy of the emblemata of iselburg in old german rhyme published in nuremberg in fifteen hundred and seventeen and a superbly bound exemplar of the altdeutsche wälder of grimm’ ‘not for salenot for saleoh no’ exclaimed the little old man eagerly ‘they belong to my private library’ ‘also the mascarades monastiques of rabelli’ pursued flaxius pitilessly ‘’tis sold’ cried the bookseller as if alarmed ‘it isn’t but never mind i don’t want to buy them yet i would like to see your collection’ ‘ach so’ responded the ancient visibly relieved ‘komm herein du lieber gast wenn du nichts im beutel hast ‘“enter as a welcome guest if thou really nothing hast if thou’rt poor then sit thee down if thou’st money get thee gone”’ and with this invitation he led the way into a marvellous old german interior which looked as if it had been painted by some artist who was as i once heard a french artist say ‘mad on the middle age and earlier time’ for it was heavily arched and looked like the crypt of a cathedral or the stube of the giant tavern in the hofgasse of innsbruck which is indeed lovely to behold and far away finer than the auerbach keller of leipzig all around were books books of tarnished gold in old ivoryparchment bindings books in tremendous plank covers of old oak knobbed with bronze or iron like castle doors books in marvellous cutvellum with rich gothic grotesques and silver clasps of extravagant richness books on shelves and heaped up in piles like rubbish everywhere booksand such books ’twas a vision a dream an endless promise of a bibliomaniac’s paradise and there the two sat for hours turning over the black letter of the olden time like two wizards evoking the spirits of the dead which indeed the scholar always does when he reads reverently in such books which were made and once studied by the departed for it is in his thoughts that the writer lives in after ages and he is ever with us as we read the dealer was enchanted also with his guest hearing the wondrous words and ponderous stories strange which were uttered in calm solemn tone and a rapt shuddering stole over him as they turned some old and legendleaved book mysterious to behold while he learned priceless secrets enhancing the value even of what he most esteemed flaxius took up an old workdas schachzabelspiel of jacob manuel of 1536 ‘there seems to be something in the binding’ he said ‘perhaps some old paper may i examine it’ he bent back with care the thin parchment and drew out a manuscript of perhaps twenty leaves which had been put in to stiffen the binding as wastepaper ‘this is indeed a find’ he solemnly remarked ‘a great discovery’ ‘what is it’ ‘a manuscript play as yet unknown by hans sachs entitled die weisse rabe or the white raven with the motto from the renner of trimberg ‘“selten wir gesehen haben swarze swanen und weisse raben seldom have we ever seen black swans or ravens white i ween” it bears the signature of the author hans sachs’ ‘blessed be the storm which drove thee to my gate blessed be this day and hour and the mother who bore thee and all and everything dear unto thee’ cried the bookseller ‘lo it has been the dream of my life to find that playi have seen it in visions i have prayed for it i would have given a finger an eye yea my choicest book to even behold it’ ‘and now it is thine’ replied flaxius gently ‘and indeed it wasde factothine own discovery since thou didst lead me here and it was in thy possession’ the old man clasped the manuscript to his heart and kissed it reverently there was silence save for the pattering of the rain and anon a thunder peal which seemed like a joyous salvo fired off in honour of the event the bookseller rose with tottering steps ‘i will return anon’ he said he came back bearing two ancient bottles covered with dust and cobwebs and two tall magnificent old glass goblets ‘there is no better wine and none so old in nuremberg’ he exclaimed ‘i would not have offered it to the emperor but verily we will carouse therewithvinum bonum et suave lætificat’ ‘gurgle gluck gluck’ sang the wine as it came forth again into the world after a century of slumber ‘hearest thou’ cried the old man ‘gluck gluck they are words of good omen this day i have had good luck’ and he drank solemnlyfeierlichto his guest ‘the wine’ said flaxius as he touched his glass to his host’sit was like the ringing of cowbells heard afar on a mountain side in the tyrol‘is like a butterfly long imprisoned as a chrysalis under earth which now comes forth to shine in light for a brief spacethe butterfly gladdens the child and wine gladdens man’ ‘and poetry like that gladdens everybody’ cried the host ‘albeit i confess that i love it best when it is printed in a rare old book’ ‘what is this’ said flaxius taking up a little manuscript ‘truly a quaint thing a fourteenthcentury transcript or translation of a far older work of earliest german times the vision of baldemar now lost it is unique i pray you accept it as a gift’ flaxius would have declined the offer but the old man who had inquired the name of his visitor took a pen and wrote therein in a very ancient but distinct hand which seemed to be uniform and contemporary with the writing of the manuscript itself to the moſt learned and very honourable domino flaxio this work is preſented with humbleſt regards as a trifling teſtimonial of inexpreſſible gratitude from his moſt devoted servant bucherwurm schmoker ‘hast mir geschassen großes glück doch wenig geb’ ich dir zurück giebst du mir was schenk’ ich dir das’ ‘great pleasure hast thou made for me but little i return thee thou giv’st a lot i but a jot’ ‘what a thing’ thought flaxius ‘it is for man in this life to set his mind on something and when so setting to make a dead set cooking all his victuals as the gypsies say “adré yeck kekavi” in one pot for they hold by traditionthe romany cookbook being as yet unpublishedthat when all conceivable food is thus boiled it acquires like mississippi punch an additional agreeable flavour with every new ingredient eggs carrots ham butter chickens bread turnips honey hedgehogs snails oatcake rice herrings a suckingpig muttonchops raisins bacon cold plumpudding cabbage and anything else edible being welcomed to the mixtumcompositum which is declared to be so palatable that the author of rookwood assures us that when dick turpin the highwayman first tasted it he actually shed tears of delight ‘so hath it been with the venerable bucherwurm schmoker who hath cast into the one passion of antique literature all the emotions and feelings hopes and affections of life i have heard that among the five thousand commandments which were appended by the devil and society to those of mosesthe which i do propose some day to publishthere is one which says “put not all thy eggs into one basket” but there is great pleasure in breaking commandments especially when one desires like the french lady to make with them an omelette aux confitures and there is also great delight in concentrating our feelings as the devil observed when he saw that the mystics united the excess of piety with that of earthly pleasure “cela suffit”quotha ‘this venerable schmoker seems to me like the thornbush of the poet of which it would be hard to say how it could ever have been young it looks so old and grey like rock or stone all overgrown with lichens to the very top or thoughts of some primeval time which fain would give it all the grime which they have gathered up yet underneath this aged thorn there is a lovely hill of moss wherein are exquisite curling lines and scarletorangetawnysableivory flowers which seen with a glass do to perfection resemble the enlacements and tracery and fancied flowers of an illuminated manuscript and therein and therefore do the fairies love to dwell and sit lovemaking of a moonlit night ‘and if i think thereon i needs must laugh remembering that all the world thinks that such an erudite old dryasdust leads the most arid infestive humdrum prosy life given to old and longforgotten things buried in the rust of antiquity palætiology archæology which all like the dismal grove in tieck’s wondrous tale do but conceal a sunny elfinland of quaint caprice and merry wanton joy as every antiquary and folklorist who is anything better than a mechanical maker of tables and a clipper and collector of variants well knows serious indeed now an’ i had time good people i would tackle calvin knox and chalmers and young of the night thoughts and show you what mephistopheli what humbugs what subtle deceivers of self or others and what mad humorists they all were and in what hampton court mazes they led their followers for meaning it or not it came to that and ye who cannot perceive it think that the partition six feet high over which ye cannot peep is the top of heaven’s wall yea i repeat for meaning it or not it comes to that ‘vale corcule goodnight old parable for there is in thee a deeper meaning than men divine sleep well o mirror of ten thousand books whom i have made happy by adding unto them “one volume more” as dibdin sweetly sang’ when flaxius opened the door it was a bright fullmoonlit night clear and fresh and gently breezy gauzy cloudlets flitting now and then before the stars like transparent veils blowing away or waving before the eyes of eastern girls so he went to his dwelling and the night being young sat down to read the little book which ran as follows baldemar’s troume the vision of baldemar as in slumber once i lay in a wood one summer day all beneath an oaken tree with green leafcurtain fair to see flowers peeped upward from below to the sun as he did go and the drops fresh from the showers looked lovingly upon the flowers like bright eyes as clear as glass or diamonds glittering in the grass and all around from many a bloom there came a pleasant fresh perfume while in the forest all day long dame nightingale did tell her song12 by me ran a spring full clear and it sounded to my ear with its steady murmuring like children who a lesson sing or as one who reads alone to himself in single tone while the wind in harmony rustled sweet in every tree flies and bees the measure kept all in chorusso i slept now whether i from sleep awoke to life again beneath the oak or whether i did deeper sink in dreams i know not what to think yet this i know that i was there where i had been but in the air and all around there was a change unto another life and strange as if one should sleep in spring when all is green and burgeoning then wake in autumn to behold the trees all clad in red and gold for other sounds i seemed to hear other scents were in the air elfin light shone all around and new herbage on the ground there full silently had come as strangers move into a home there i sat but had not known it was on the wildè stone13 that i had fallen into sleep since there the elves their watches keep and he who sitteth there an hour for all that week is in their power but this secret well i knew and now lived to find it true that the man who passes well into the spirit of the spell meets with nothing to alarm nor will come to any harm many marvels he may learn many wondrous things discern if he sleep an hour alone in faith upon the wildè stone as in silence still i sat marvelling in amaze thereat i soon heard a sudden sound as of a footstep on the ground and looking up there in the wood a vision fair before me stood when all at once the forest rang in chorus all the birdés sang and wondrous flowers in bright array came shooting to the light of day14 and in all her beauty’s sheen before me stood the fairy queen thus she spoke ‘o minstrel dear long have i longed to see thee here for it is in our destiny that if not placed in poetry although we live in lordly state with wealth and power and titles great we’ll pass unto oblivion’s shame unless some poet notes our name there is more life in one small song than in a century ‘mid the throng with all their work and war and strife song only is eternal life ‘mid all great deedstoo great to last men seek the poems of the past and one sweet lay as all may see may make an immortality it may full long forgotten lie yea sleep for many a century hidden away in darkling nook yet be revived in many a book for though states fade and tongues may die there is no death for poetry since unto it we well may say “a thousand years are as a day” ’tis god’s own voice which when it spoke in poetry the silence broke to inspiration doth belong and it alone the power of song even we who are of fairy kind are least of all unto it blind since all the life which we receive legends or lays unto us give for all of our appointed time is measured by the poet’s rhyme unless we’re sung we soon are not and even our name would be forgot therefore to me o baldemere thou art indeed of men most dear long i have lived in hope to be but mentioned in thy minstrelsy even in one line be’t low or high for then i know i ne’er can die’ all had grown silent as she spoke no sound the forest stillness woke the nightingales had ceased to sing the brook had stopped its murmuring a sudden peace had come to pass over the wrangling flowers and grass15 for well i noted all had been listening with joy unto their queen with some sweet hope that they might be included in the poetry and this i did with love recall that fairy life is in them all her voice again the silence broke and wavering with the sunshine spoke as it came flickering through the leaves as broideress her pattern weaves singing meanwhile a melody with her design in harmony and thus she said ‘o come with me and thou a wondrous sight shalt see fit for a song my baldemere if thou canst read its meaning clear for we must go’ i naught could say so followed as she showed the way right wild and rugged was the road through passes strange which long we trode great rocks above us darkly hung while peaks like towers o’er them sprung and grim and griesly was the way scaping so oft the light of day we did not seem to climb a steep but rather down in earth to creep wherein we heard and time again the sough of winds the rush of rain then wended from a passage cold into a forest grey and old where every tree seemed all alone for they had changed long since to stone every leaf and twig was there as if they had been carven fair and all ywrought in imagery as men do work in ivory making for brides their caskets rare anon we came unto a stair each step whereof was wondrous broad and strangely high it was with awe i asked its meaning and was told ’twas made by giant hands of old yet up we went nor did we stop till we had gained the mountain top where in the twilight golden brown upon a bench we sate adown long it was ere i could speak for both my soul and tongue were weak with all the wonderful surprise at what was spread before my eyes for never yet in dream or scroll came such a picture to my soul nor yet in visions told of eld compared to what i there beheld straight from our feet like any wall an awful precipice did fall ne’er had i thought of one so steep it seemed ten thousand fathoms deep while down below a valleyed bay spread beyond vision far away and the wild waters of that sea showed all that in eternity since earth hath been or time began was ever seen by living man rising from darkness into light then fading into sheen more bright a life which was a sparkling spring and then anon evanishing for there were forms of women fair like ivorythen lost in air or buried in the billowcaves as goblins vanish into graves strong warriors with stretching arms pursuing still those wondrous forms or revelling as at glorious feasts with all were mingled fearful beasts upleaping roaring rioting withal full many an idle thing as minstrels carolling their lays and forms of longforgotten days and dwarfs who dwell in mossy stone and spectres flitting all alone and dead men floating in their shrouds with dragons breathing fiery clouds blinding all round with ruddy light and then in darkness lost to sight there too were castles halls and bowers with wondrous battlements and towers beyond them others rising high and others still unto the sky with gardens broad and forests fair yet ever fading into air and fields with fountains interlaid where troops of merry children played with gentle deer and snowwhite lambs and nuns asinging evenpsalms fading anon with all the rest like sunset clouds into the west on earth there is no thing i ween which in that sea could not be seen all that is common all that’s rare all that is humble or is fair with every known or unknown thing coming to life and vanishing all blending tending into one as vapours fade before the sun chasing embracing or anon in deadly strife and then agone therein i felt all that can be in life to all eternity long at that wondrous sea i gazed as one half pleased but more amazed till step by step upon my soul there came the feeling of the whole and then a strange and boundless awe as i conceivéd what i saw until the thought which seized me there became too terrible to bear for what surpasses poetry i ween is far too much for me life hath its limits and this strife is far too great for mortal life a shudder seemed in me to rise and overborne i closed my eyes when a soft whisper in my ear said ‘’tis enough o baldemere’ and as the fairy to me spoke i started at the word and woke i lay upon the wildèstone all in the forest and alone deepthinking on the things i’d seen and then i sang ‘o fairy queen thou shalt in deed recorded be by baldemere in poetry god grant that this my humble lay may live in truth for many a day would i could give it grace divine not for my honour but for thine’ ‘haec fabula docet’ wrote the master ‘firstly that there is no earthly immortality like that of song now it is to be noted that in their day and time men give little real heed to any save a very few of the greatest living poets treating minor bards with a neglect which history clearly shows is most undeserved for the vitality of even fourthclass poetry is marvellous it is recovered and reprinted centuries after it has been forgotten by all what scholar is there who when raking over piles of fifteenthcentury theological legal and even historical rubbish which will only sell for wastepaper has not been charmed at finding in ito happy mana book of ballads or even of poetry of any kind ’tis little thought upon this life of song there’s not one poet of the present day however small his art and weak his lay who hath not better chance to live for aye and speak at times to some congenial soul than any other fancied famous man ‘there is many a small beingay more than any dreamwho will live like a fly in amber merely because he has known conversed with and thereby identified himself with some poet so small that even the fly did not know that the other had ever rhymed at all it is little to the credit of any civilised country that it can excessively honour and envy and glorify an upper ten or twenty thousand in great britain or a four hundred in america and not include in the number more than a dozen poets if people cared more for poetry they would enlarge the number for there are in very truth some hundreds cruelly ignoredall sneering critics to the contrary he is an evil being to me who would belittle crush or condemn almost any poetry whatever for even in the very mediocre where there has been inspiration and love there is a gleam as of something divine which i must needs reverence truly indeed the muse may have been only a very small fairy elf or goblin or even a witch but it has a spark of the supernatural or occult treat it tenderly therefore as something born with mystic powers and there is also a lesson in the bookseller himself which rightly read and widely understood would do good in the world there are thousands of people who would fain travel into foreign lands and see strange people when there are all around them in life men far more marvellous than turks or indians or beings wellnigh as queer as goblins they go about silently like shadows in a kind of twilight of society living in a fourth dimension enjoying senses all unknown to us hearing sounds which never reach our ears lit by a light which never cheered our eyes such are the collectors and readers like this old man who steep their very hearts of hearts in the feelings of the past and give to every thought that chiaroscuro of the romance of age which is the final beauty of art it is one of the sarcasms of truth that such a dryasdust who has become among fools the very type and symbol of commonplace dulness is in reality all the time in a fairyland too fine for the philistine with his great horny eyes to even perceive for he in a blackletter book feels with exquisite sympathy all that romance which was in all life in an earlier age feels it directly and in itself while another only gets a coarse burlesque or imitation of it from novels plays and lordmayorshows of poems there are very few in this world who feel or even understand in reality this spirit in which the bookseller has his being more’s the pityfor it brings a great deal of happiness to the possessor hand in hand with it like a twin goes the fairy of collecting this spirit too is far misunderstood he who having got together more money than he can spend ridicules the collector of postagestamps or buttons is like the lunatic in hogarth’s picture laughing at his like they are all one or the other inspired by what the gamblerscholar pascasius justus called the insatiabilis habendi libido similis ventriculi magnæ voracitatis the unsatiable desire of possession which is like a gnawing ceaseless hunger the which as he adds may do no harm if it be properly supplied with good food the delight of the collector is in renewing certain pleasant feelings which he experienced before which some think is ninetenths of the pleasure of love or of intoxication or anything else and that in very truth man is man because he has more memory and passion than any other animal and more ganglion nay there have been rakes and don juans who found their chief pleasure not in pleasure but in accumulating conquests that is by collecting by adding to the list which some pitiful leporello bears now as collecting is a humananimal instinct as is shown by the raven magpie and other creatures and love and religion and art were nothing more in their beginnings it may be that as we improve it too may be developed to a holy thing or a great institution for in it lies the secret of history and of folklore and of preservation of relics which will be clear to ye all when ye read my great work on the science of collecting in all its branches 12 ‘vor dem walde was sîn ganc dâ diu naktegale sanc’ walther von der vogelweide 13 ‘der arme grêgôrius nü beleip er alsus uf dem wilden steine aller gnāden eine’ hartmann von der aue 1320

topworn state of oxidation and mossgrown rustiness was now so far as he could beholdand it wound like a serpent up and down rolling hills and over tremendous rocks for half a century of miles till it vanished in an invisible grey threadcompletely restored as if by contract all its ancient towers being likewise correctly renewed as if by some chinese gilbert scott at its base at the rate of about one to the acre were bungalows of graceful construction but all without chimneys16 rising from tufted groves and gardened plains in whose architecture the old chinese style seemed curiously mingled with other influences a very striking feature indeed was that of many colossal towers about a mile one from the other every one as flaxius estimated being about one thousand feet in height hearing a rustling sound hard by he looking up perceived a man alighting from what he at once understood was a flyingmachine it had come unseen and noiselessly as an owl whence as flaxius divined it had proceeded with incredible speed the newcomer who seemed to be about thirty years of age was a man of attractive countenance manly and evidently intelligent altogether the right sort of man for the right sort to meet he was clad in a graceful but extremely practical garb of some material new even to the sage as for nationality he was certainly european and probably english but his first greeting to the immortal was in a singular jargon which appeared to be based upon the pidgin once dear to flaxius in bygone years ‘come sta my flin what onepiecey man you be my no savvy youno hè te jamas vistonever looksee you before onetime allo my lifeo’ ‘i understand you’ replied flaxius ‘but i also speak english’ ‘oh of course’ replied the stranger with a genial smile ‘only a fellow gets so into the habit of pidgining it comes from flying about’ ‘naturally’ observed flaxius the stranger darted at him a quick glance and then looked about anxiously as if fearful that some one had overheard them observing in a hurried low tone ‘i say don’t do that again joking’s against the law you know’ ‘i did not know it’ replied flaxius ‘but why are you so much astonished at not knowing me’ ‘because’ replied the stranger ‘i cannot recall ever meeting anybody in all my life whom i had not seen before you know how it is nowadays when everybody goes flying about and all the world is acquainted and as you are evidently a superior sort of person i am indeed utterly amazed at not knowing you because i would have sworn that from china to peru there was not one gentleman with whom i was not i may say intimate’ ‘but you must count your acquaintances by millions’ replied flaxius ‘certainly’ answered the stranger gravely ‘i know nine hundred and eightyfour million seven hundred and fiftyeight thousand four hundred and twentyeight men and women by face and name since the new system of accretive memorising has come in and the whole world has got mixed up and keeps mixing everybody knows everybody’ ‘and does everybody now know everything’ inquired flaxius as nearly astonished as he had ever been during the whole course of his long and wellspent life ‘well among all the whiter people of age i think it may be fairly asserted that every grownup person knows all that man has ever known of course only the most advanced scientists and deducers are really well acquainted with the knowledge of the future but who in the name of the prima materia are you who put such incomprehensibly odd questions’ ‘i have been’ replied flaxius ‘out of the world for a century and am utterly ignorant of all that has taken place during that time’ the stranger did not seem to doubt the assertion nor to be much astonished as he merely remarked ‘i have heard there were a few of the very far advanced who could do that and you look like one of them and i suppose of course they keep it a secret so if you wish it i will say nothing to anybody now to know what has been doing since you left is a long story do you know where to lodge tonight’ ‘no’ replied flaxius ‘unless it be à la belle étoile’ ‘we can sleep in any of these bungalows’ replied the stranger ‘i have coupons entitling us to rooms and food and medical attendance and social attentions anywhere in the world’ ‘i have plenty of gold money’ observed flaxius ‘money’ exclaimed the stranger as if astonished ‘well certainly money can be exchanged for coupons and coins are rising rapidly in value for collections and museums but coupons issued in all cities pass current all the world over at par but let us get to our quarters and i will tell you the rest’ he invited flaxius to enter the machine in which there was room for two and a trunk with some comfortable wrappings then as he turned a handle they shot off upward and onward like the wind as they flew they overtook two other aerevolantes like their own when flaxius’s friend exclaiming ‘good fellows good luck’ ignited several small coloured squibs or minute rocketsit had by this time grown darkwhich were responded to by a single red spark from each ‘i invited them to meet an interesting stranger whom i have just discovered’ remarked the stranger with a laugh ‘my name is oakford’ he added ‘and it is pidgined into oakforto yoursflaxius that will become flasio or flaso ah here we are’ he stopped at a large and somewhat singular though pretty house before which sat in a garden at tables several welldressed ladies and gentlemen of a somewhat eurasian appearance an elderly woman examined the coupons which oakford presented ‘take double’ he remarked ‘i want extra food this is a distinguished man of science’ hearing this the landlady and all the rest present rose and bowed low to flaxius but with all their politeness it was evident that they were utterly amazed which oakford explained by saying ‘they have all travelled so much that they never saw a stranger before in all their lives’ ‘now for a paradox i call that a good one’ reflected flaxius ‘that at least remains in the world’ ‘may i mention the fact that you have been absent from the world for a century’ inquired oakford of the sage ‘these are all gentlemen and ladiesthat is welleducated and of strict principles’ ‘certainly’ replied flaxius ‘this my dear friends’ then resumed oakford ‘is a scientist and philosopher of the very highest rank since he has been absent from the world for more than a century as you are all aware only one among many millions ever achieves such extraordinary power and from it you can draw your own conclusions’ the party which had been augmented by the arrival of two additional gentlemen with ladies all gazed at flaxius with an expression of such sympathetic intelligence as he had rarely met among mortals in the earlier time and then approaching him very reverently bowed and worshipped each addressing him a short prayer after which the sage perceiving that a benediction was hoped for gave it with impressive feeling to their very great satisfaction ‘you must understand’ explained oakford ‘that the religion which now prevails is that the creative force manifests itself in the ascending series of ideals and most perfectly in man therefore we worship him in one another but chiefly in the advanced scientist since it is to the power in him that we are chiefly indebted for inventions and all that does us any good’ ‘ah’ exclaimed flaxius ‘you have somewhat changed religion as it was a century ago then men chiefly worshipped firstly themselves and secondly politicians who instead of doing any good to anybody made all the devil’s own mischief they could in every way and were all the more admired for it’ ‘you speak of the devil’ remarked oakford ‘it must have been curious to live in the world when people believed in such a being and thought they saw his influence manifest in all things’ ‘h’m’ quoth the sage ‘if you have succeeded in getting the devil entirely out of everything and removed all traces of his existence i will say this for you that you have more than realised my greatest expectations and fondest hopes’ ‘nay we have only got rid of the initial d but that is the first step by scientifically supplying natural wants and discouraging the development of needless ones we have very much extinguished the worst forms of selfishness’ ‘ah that initial d’ said flaxius ‘the dee ‘“there was a jolly miller lived by the river dee who sang as i care for nobody then nobody cares for me”’ ‘i grant that evil still remains in many a form’ resumed oakford ‘but science and philanthropy have combined to a degree which would once have been deemed incredible being supplied with all the power which mankind could contribute to investigate and extinguish it the vast interest which all mankind took a century ago in the idle squabbling of windy politicians that is in mere factional silly quarrels about nothing or human cockfighting in oratory has been supplanted owing to the ascendency of the man of science by a general and serious interest in what really concerns our earthly welfare perhaps we have not accomplished so much as you may have anticipated but to this we have really come increased liberalism has so far diminished prejudices that the world has pretty well agreed as to what it really wants first of all’ ‘a tremendous progress’ interpolated flaxius ‘it is ninetenths of the battle won to know what we want is almost equivalent to having all we need’ ‘well let us toilette and then refresh’ said oakford ‘here is your room if you want anything press the button and speak’ ‘and then the servant will come to receive orders’ ‘no for you must first form in your own mind an image by volitional pseudophiathat is depicting by willand this image is with your voice conveyed to the chambermaid thus you want two silk towels you close your eyes form their image and order the maid touches the button closes her eyes beholds two silk towels and brings them some men of sciencein fact i can do it myself to a certain extentmake the towels for themselves at once out of the atmosphere by a peculiar mental physiological process but the less expert prefer the maid’ ‘h’m’ quoth flaxius as a very ladylike pretty damsel appeared ‘i should think indeed that with many travellers the volitional physiological effort would be chiefly exerted in that direction’ ‘the position of servant in a house specially frequented by men of science’ pursued oakford ‘is regarded as a great honour and only conferred on highlyeducated and deserving persons this young lady’ he continued ‘is the only daughter of the celebrated kienlongna who first converted roseleaves into butterflies he being indeed a leader among the mighty minds who broke away the barrier between organic or inorganic creative chemistry and proved that living creatures could be made in the laboratory it is even said that he has actually succeeded in making a human child but as regards that his daughter here can give you better information this was said with the utmost gravity and the lady chambermaid responded quite as seriously but with interest ‘yes it is true he has established the fact beyond all question that it can be done by subetherising protoplasm even in the fourth grade but i must admit that the specimens of work which he has thus far produced are not remarkably creditable to his skill nor very attractive’ ‘now if i had heard that a century ago’ mused flaxius ‘i should have taken the liberty to deny it but i suppose that science has even extinguished frenchmen by this time by nemesis i would like to know what this chambermaid thinks when she turns overif she ever doesspecimens of what constituted ninetenths of the reading of young ladies at the end of the last century or what she thinks if she indeed stoops to think of those who revelled in it or supplied it holy science thou hast indeed taken a great deal of fun out of life but thou hast outbalanced the loss with abundant honest decency’ ‘i must explain to you also’ said oakford ‘though you doubtless surmise it that such positions are in request because it is only in a comparatively few great families or establishments that servants are kept at all since scientific appliances now enable people to do everything for themselves waiting has become a refined and elegant accomplishment which can only be properly filled by ladies of superior education in fact it is very mortifying to a girl to have it said of her that she is always seen as a guest and never as a waiter it enables a young lady to see society and the world and become more intimately acquainted with people of intellect’ the supper or evening refreshment did not surprise flaxius as a novelty because it was precisely the same as that which he had enjoyed during his visit to the god of ancient days and on other transcendental occasions it consisted simply of a cake to each guest with a bottle of whatfor want of a better termi may call wine both however were the very perfection of food and drink turning to the assembled company oakford said ‘i propose my friends to give to our distinguished guest some account of what changes have taken place in the world as regards food since he last honoured this planet by residing in it and will be pleased if you would kindly aid me in so doing to begin with i think i may broadly state that chemistry as the word was understood completed its first stage or that of analysis about a hundred years ago and then began to attempt synthesis or the combination of the elements’ ‘it was at the same time’ remarked the waitingmaid ‘that the elements were reduced to one’ ‘quite right one of the first results of synthesis was to make not only metals but all kinds of substances including every variety of food for a long time men persistedas many of the less educated still doin liking only imitations of what they had preferred in earlier ages such as meat and fish or certain vegetables and fruits i myself have several times eaten muttonchops and once a roasted chicken and i think i once ate a pea’ ‘history repeats itself’ mused flaxius ‘but in a very short time good palatable food was produced so cheaply and in such immense quantities that finally every human being was supplied for nothing with a daily ration it being now the fundamental law that all who are born are entitled to food lodging clothes and facilities for mental improvement and recreation’ ‘did not this have the effect of creating a vast mass of idlers’ inquired flaxius ‘my dear master’ remarked one of those present ‘you will probably have conjectured that during the past century history has been made more rapidly and the world has passed through more important changes than it had during all its earlier period of warfare and theology with incoherent spasmodic or despairing struggles we have had terrible trials and as yet are only beginning to realise what we have still to do in fact i often think that we have thus far done almost next to nothing with all our science and that the one great glory of this our century is that we have reduced a chaos to something like order and have produced a mere beginning from which those who are to succeed us may proceed with something like union and mutual intelligence’ there was a general murmur of approbation at these words when oakford again spoke ‘there was much idleness and more discontent than ever more complaining over dainty food than there ever had been during famines wherein thousands died of starvation the reason being that those who were the most intelligent and industrious could still earn more than others and feed better but man is really after all a working animal and as the grosser and more intolerable kinds of labour were relieved by mechanical invention and agriculture and raising animals gave way to artificial food and education and culture advanced great changes and improvements came about and though as i truly said we are far from being out of all these social troubles we think we see our way out and have in the main succeeded in conquering those horrible pests of poverty dirt disease and social discontent which once raged so terribly when you were formerly in the world even at the end of the nineteenth century when there was such a sad period of pessimism and doubt and despair and such warring elements of labour and capital and religion and politics men had done great and good work it would seem as if by mere instinct to do good ay it brought forth evolution ‘and evolution which had been conceived and born as one may say by the naturphilosophie of germany was warmed to new life or reborn in england by the genius of darwin wallace and their supporters from the beginning it in turn developed science and science technical art one of the first great inventions which followed the era of synthesis in chemistry was this production of artificial food in vast quantities at a very cheap rate when attention was drawn to this chemists soon found out how to vary its texture or substance’ ‘that is to say’ remarked one present ‘that it was made like meat or bread or vegetables to suit association of tastes after a time this association greatly diminished but it was discarded with great difficulty people are so conservative as regards food and taste and so convinced that what they are not accustomed to is unnatural and vile that it rose to the magnitude of a great national or rather world question but after a while the artificial food became so palpably superior to the natural both as to taste and uniform wholesomeness that the former had to give way now the poorest man has by legal right a daily ration of food such as a king would have relished in the old time ‘then came another invention which was simple enough yet which had great results it was the production of cloth fabrics of all kinds in incredible quantity very rapidly and at a very trifling cost’ ‘that sounds to me’ replied flaxius ‘like what tennyson called “a fairy tale of science” there was a story in the olden time in florence that a brownie or household goblin once served in a family where he did all the workswept the rooms cooked the dinner and played with the childrenfor nothing’ ‘that i suppose’ remarked the waitingmaid illustrates the earlier or theistic stage of society and a divine providence’ ‘ahem’ coughed flaxius ‘well the goblin was greatly loved by the eldest boy marco who observing that his elfin friend had only a red cap and a tattered and very scanty shirt for apparel had made and gave to him a full suit of red velvet whereupon the goblin declared that as he was now a fine gentleman and had dreed his weird or served his time out he would work no more’ ‘i see’ quoth the chambermaid ‘that was the church after it had attained to violet robes and gold croziers with jewelled mitres and ceased to be useful’ ‘um well the goblin ere departing gave marco a stick assuring him that whenever he would say to it “stick turn risvolge” or “unroll” it would unroll cloth velvet lace or any stuff to any extent and by means of it marco fulfilled a government contract and supplied all the clothing for the papal army in less than a quarter of an hour besides dressing up all his friends in purple and fine linen ad infinitum’ there was a laugh at this and oakford said ‘that story would not astonish any child of this generation for we can really roll out cloth with as great rapidity what is to me utterly incomprehensible is that people who knew enough to make even such simple toys as steamengines and telephones did not begin long before by making cheap cloth in fact i am astonished that the man who had the wit to make that tale had not the sense to learn from it how it could be done why the very roller suggests the whole for even then men knew how to make paper by the mile and also felt and the step from these to fibrous and clothlike stuffs was extremely simple however it really required the great discovery of making fibrine which followed immediately after that of the nature identity and relative conditions of inorganic and organic substance after that people spun all kinds of fibre out of anything now clothing like food is supplied from the government manufactory gratis to everybody the result having been to destroy the vanity of dress or ostentation of mere clothing for now that gold and diamonds are cheap and everything can be made we have very different ambitions ‘perhaps the greatest factor in producing our present state of society has been aerostation by flyingmachines the first were so rudely constructed that it is said that every other man who used one lost his life by it this proved to be such an extraordinary attraction to americans that they all went in like lunatics for flying they flew races and fought duels in the air and roamed all over the earth in machines in which no man now living would dare to go a rod we have specimens of them in our museums and i have seen bold aeronauts stand before them almost mute with horror even so columbus ventured over the atlantic in a crazy little craft ah master flaxius you must have seen awful deeds in your time and marvellously bold men who had no fear of death or suffering ‘yet pray observe friend’ he continued ‘that we do not travel so much to behold scenery or man as men did of old for now he who sits in his study can see all things on earth and hear all distant sounds by telegraph in which art we are making every day new discoveries even to dispensing with wires and seeing all the world while we sit still’ ‘i can hardly believe’ remarked a lady present ‘that there ever were people who dared to travel night and day in steamboats much more in locomotivetrains my blood almost curdles when i think of such reckless fiendish courage but i dare say’ she added after a pause ‘it was only the madlybrave like the berserkers of an early age who really did such things out of bravado master’ she suddenly exclaimed ‘did you ever see a locomotive’ ‘truly’ exclaimed flaxius ‘i travelled in my time during nearly a century many thousands of miles in such trains with ladies as gentle as yourself to say nothing of innumerable maids and children but none of us ever imagined that we were doing anything remarkably brave but i believe’ he added ‘that any of my companions would have been terrified at the idea of flying through the air like skyrockets as you do’ ‘ah’ exclaimed the waitingmaid ‘but that is a very different thing’ ‘ah h’m’ mused flaxius ‘women with all their science still retain certain traces of their primeval savage logicor nature’ ‘after the first stages’ resumed oakford ‘when the flyingmachine was very much improved and made very cheap it was at first terribly abused thieves pounced down like hawks on property and with the vehicle to carry two or three an era of abduction and elopements with women began then there was organised a grand world detective flying association which pursued thieves into the very depths of greenland or thibet or anywhere else the result being that in the end the dangerous classes were almost extirpated for when they became dangerous to everybody instead of to a few there was a general war on them’ ‘and the abductions and elopements’ inquired the sage ‘well society found itself obliged to compromise a little on that question which i must freely admit is in rather a dubious condition even at the present day while the rights of persons and things to immunity from attack are more strictly observed than ever it has in due proportion been discovered that conventional and sentimental rights or wrongs disappear with great rapidity among cosmopolites and that the emancipated woman claims the same privileges as man still on the whole from all that i have learned in books we get on far more peaceably and pleasantly than you did in the days of duels and divorcecourts and all that when people have nothing to do but fly away like birds in order to part divorce becomes too easy and so they end by pairing like birds those who have a turn for a kind of domestic life and familiesand they are in a great majorityfollow it and those who have not do pretty much as they like and are left alone unnoticed society gladly takes care of all the foundlingsvery good care indeedand it is a fact that while there was at first a very great increase in the number of such children they are now diminishing very rapidly’ ‘about ten per cent per annum’ remarked a lady ‘and last year nine and foursevenths diminution’ added the waitinggirl ‘as you have observed’ said oakford ‘the flyingmachine has led to an universal linguafranca or pidgin english and this has induced perhaps millions to speak good english the old nations are breaking up and diminishing so rapidly that millions really belong nowhere if a man is too warm any day anywhere he mounts his flyer and can in most cases be in an hour on a mountain or by the sea or vice versa whatever his calling is he can find employment enough to pay his bill in any city there is no mountain so high no valley so deep that you will not find some house of entertainment or shelter there war is unknown armies and navies have vanished before cosmopolitanism the frenchman has found to his amazement that he is not precisely the leader type and ideal of all culture intellect and intelligence on earth the american no longer passes most of his time in informing every one how much grander more beautiful and in every way superior everything is in amùraca or amáraca to everything everywhere elsein fact he has ceased to talk about himself and his country altogether because everybody has been there in like manner the english the german officers and nobility the spanish the provincial gentry of italy the niggers of barbadoes and sierra leone the jews and irish have all slowly abandoned the opinion that they are god’s special favourites and the fine fleur of creation put into this world solely to convince everybody else how degraded they are in comparison with themselves there is no use in nations annexing other countriesnobody cares where he belongs the only binding laws are those of society or mutual agreement and as the latter grow in force those of nations and creeds and circles vanish even the home does not exist for millions ‘“and now our dream of science is to pass in mental vision over all the world seeing and knowing all for we have found new senses in mankind which still reveal new qualities conditions and ideas and myriad beings who inhabit space whom men of old divined in feverish dreams and as we are there is no spot on earth unknown unto its humblest habitant while lenses quite perfected now reveal the smallest secrets of the starry world and yet we deem that we have little won but in bold hope keep ever pushing on”’ ‘you will probably be very much struck’ remarked another of the company ‘with two very general facts as you come to see the world as it is firstly the great improvement which has resulted from advanced hygiene sanitary laws and physical culture even a century ago men had begun to discover that cleanliness meant life and health and that at the end of the reign of queen victoria the average of life was more than onethird greater than it had been a century before now the deathrate in the most unhealthy parts of europe is only three in a thousand and there is great complaint as to that’ ‘it is to be noted’ added oakford ‘that it was not till about 1920 that the great question arose as to whether politics or action on public questions should be a mere matter of faction like guelf against ghibelline red versus green big endian contra little endian in which people sacrificed everything to see their public men take the place of the ancient prizefighters and quarrel people began to weary of grand old gladiators controversialists corivals and champions of all kinds and said it was time that measures took the place of men in fine the principle became a party with the motto “a plague o’ both your houses” and the end was the substitution of questions of practical utility for “politics” diplomacy foreign quarrels and courtintrigues ‘when this principle was once adopted it became a burning question and was acted on with great energy when people awoke to the fact that they had really been fooling themselves more than they had been fooled by their leaders and that they themselves were really the government if they did but know it men of science and of action yes men of great vigorous and practical minds nurtured in evolution and true principles of history and sociology sprung up like a race of giants and extinguished the talking politicians and mere scholars it was perhaps the turningpoint in history itself and to us it ranks even above the reformation in germany and the emancipation in america for it was the substitution of the practical human interests of all for the idle power and ostentation of a few ‘then it was that the accumulations of capital made by a few or by syndicates and trusts were transferred to governments for the use of the people so that it seemed providential that they had acted as they did ‘it is wonderful that at the end of the nineteenth century when these and a hundred other causes had clearly begun to work so few foresaw to what they would lead men did not note that the immense accumulation of capital and rapidly increasing ease of making money would inevitably transfer it all to government and revolutionise society “it will not come in our time” was the cry they did not realise either the great law that population diminishes and improves in proportion to culture and least of all did they comprehend the unity and tendency of all this with improved sanitary reforms education transit by air and free food and clothing with less hard work or gross labour indeed until these advances had been made they could not be coordinated yet it is in that that the very life of society and progress lies ‘among the first great public measures which took the place of mere words such as conservative and liberal or republican and democratic was that of health and cleanliness which at once led to gentler humanity and abhorrence of cruelty both as regarded men and animals men became at first intolerant as regarded seeing others suffer from poverty and finally detested pain in every form i dare say that you can recall much which would now seem incredible to the greatest brute now living’ ‘truly i can’ replied flaxius ‘there was a very good sort of man named alexis of piedmont who wrote a book of quaint odds and ends of amusement in which he gave a recipe how a goose could be roasted alive it was very ingenious indeed but cruel to the last degree of torture and it ended with these words “then take it from the fire and serve it up and though roasted it will still be living and will cry out loud while it is being carved which is a very merry thing to behold” it was republished in many books for generations after and in fact there was a great deal of amusement at the very end of the nineteenth century much patronised by the very élite of society which was very little worse than this bulls were literally tortured to death in paris in imitation of spanish sport gentlemen were present at prize fights ladies at pigeon shooting and perhaps no day passed in which some magistrate did not let some wretch guilty of horrible and infamous cruelty to children or women escape with ten shillings’ fine or a few days’ imprisonment even a man guilty of cruelties very far surpassing anything ever told of red indians or inquisitors or torturers of the middle agesi say this advisedlycruelties wickeder than a thousand murders was after public trial only sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment and the general manner in which such things were treated was to smile complacently and say “ah yes but a little roughness and knocking about makes us manly” under the same impression there survived in society among the most refined people a vast amount of covert satire innuendo vexation by assuming superiority sneersin short the vileness of building self up on the abasement of others as one may see in half the humorous pictures setting forth the coarse fun of the time torture by the peine forte et dure was not abolished by law in england till the year 1823 or thereabout yet all this did not make people braver or more manly it crushed and frightened the weak or the majority it developed bullying and it drove the wouldbe dignified into reserve hauteur and coldness which was all in fact only a masque for mean cowardice and vanity yet there were with all this certain curious antitheses not without great beauty which i apprehend you have now quite lost there was in the cruellest ages the madonnalike saintly meekness and innocence yea purity which i apprehend has now taken very different formor vanished there was a romance and personal character in it all which i suppose is now unknown to you’ ‘it is true that we have lost immensely since we have been guided solely by science and commonsense and utility’ remarked an elderly man who had not before spoken ‘we have lost much of domestic life or homefeeling and as i infer from what i heard from old people in my youth and extensive study of ancient books we have no longer the sweet and genial ideals or inspirations of art and faith poetry and humour which once fired the world they have all sunk to the level of very inferior races and children who indeed are rapidly growing ashamed of them but then we have gained what compensates for it all a thousandfold we are no longer sentimental or despairing or pessimistic nor is the poison of soft sorrow in our every cup and in every kiss in fact if a man of a hundred years ago were among us now he would probably decide that we do not know what love is and to judge from the poems and novels of the olden time i should say that it is decidedly lucky that we do not for such a mass of misery philandering caprices quarrels tears and agonies as men anciently went through with according to their romances before they could accomplish the extremely simple and prosaic end of marriageor similar unionpasses all comprehension suggesting a mixture of hell and lunacy add to this that with all their “beautiful poetry” and genial humour every biography of the time shows us lives steeped in a deep consciousness of woe and suffering with so little mitigation of it according to their own deepest convictions that one must needs see very plainly that they paid a fearful price for all their delightful domestic affections and devoted loves of one fond heart for their home circles and piety and fine art of all sorts yes an awful price not worth the whistle we at least do not wail and howl and sing and pray when anything is wrong with us we go to the doctor and if he says we are all right we get on the flyingmachine and skim over the seas and mountains when we are not busied with science or practical matters we are engaged in taking our recreation and between the two we have really no time for sentiment of any kind’ ‘i observe’ replied flaxius ‘that you are rapidly losing or have entirely lost hometies domestic feelings the warm attachment to a native land or patriotism devotion to a church or religion with all the ancient form or spirit of art and poetryin fact nearly all that once was supposed to form all that a man ought to live for including the ideal of self or character but with it you have lost their terrible sorrows and you have gained stupendously more than you have lost in a grand philanthropy which the men of the past regarded as mere moonshine or utopian everything in its time every man is your friend nowno one your enemyquarrelling is bad form for it is unscientific i see in you the beginning of an entirely new race of beings you are neither happy nor unhappy as those words were once understoodin short you would have been utterly incomprehensible to everybody a hundred years ago but they would in the end have feared you like giants and vanished before you as the red indian is crushed morally by the white man therefore you are great and i a man of the ages tremble to think what awful what stupendous power you are destined to attain you will master every law of nature and conquer death and the grave space and time what were the greatest glories of art and the highest flights of poetry or genius are already beginning to appear to you as frivolous and rococo because they were founded on false or vanished unrealities while you are pressing forward into such a realisation of the real in all its immensity as it never entered into the heart of man to conceive ye are already dreaming of doingnay ye have in part donewhat homer of old would not have dared attribute to the gods ye take unto yourselves wings and are in the earliest rosy dawn even in the depths of ocean ye are there ye spin forth gold or pearl or diamond from the air as ye will when ye will or will soon do so it is as easy now to create and combine atoms as to breathe to build a towered castle is easier and cheaper than it was to construct a cottage of yore and it is all but the beginning of the beginnings of the very rudiments compared to what is to come you will read with perfected lenses the minutest secrets of all the stars discover new senses and through them new orders of existence not now perceptible to man and with every new discovery will come ten more daring dreams of others far far beyond it and they will also be realised in such illimitable achievements man must pass so far beyond all old conceptions of every kind that all will shrivel up and vanish terribly grand wilt thou be o humanity of the future’ there was a pause when the eldest one again spoke ‘thou hast understood us humanity has hitherto been in its boyhood pleased with its pretty toys and fancies indulging in passion or despair at every trifle now it is advancing to eternal manhood and growing serious which means more truly happy it is leaving the paternal home and all petty ties and beliefs and going out into the world to do and dare in the past lay the fabled infinite power of the gods in the future lies the illimitable might of man what man has never done man can do is the motto of the future’ then the waitingmaid spoke more gaily ‘but to prove to our guest that art has not as yet quite left the world and that we still retain some trace of oldfashioned entertainment i propose that master oakford who is an expert in hypnotising give us all a pleasant drama with magnificent scenery and dresses so that we may all have something cheerful in our memories before we retire to rest’ this proposal met with general approbation and master oakford explained it to flaxius as follows ‘you must know that we now have spectacles theatrical entertainments operas and exhibitions of the most varied description for all the world at no expense whatever in every family there is some one who is the special hypnotiser and in larger assemblies masters on a greater scale these mastersof whom i am onestore their memories with all that can conduce to entertainment then we keep by us or indeed generally find in every house an infinite amount of music songs speeches or dialogues such as were once recorded on tinfoil but which are now kept imperishable on a new and better material ‘when the performance begins i hypnotise all present impressing it on their minds that they are about to see a certain spectacle and that they are to vividly behold certain scenery or persons by this method and the aid of phonographs and monologue i give them a very perfect entertainment pray note two things one is that i will them to vividly remember all that they have seen when they awake secondly that the art of understanding and of enjoying such plays is very much improved with practice’ ‘much of this’ remarked flaxius ‘was known to the egyptian chaldæan and etruscan priests of yore and it perished with them or lingered in broken fragments among witches and sorcerers i know so much of it that you need not hypnotise me who am indeed master of the art but i will most gladly enter into sympathetic perception with both the actor and the audience’ those present sat in a semicircle and by unanimous request oakford was requested to give shakespeare’s play of macbeth it was only necessary for flaxius to take the hand of one of the auditors in his ownit chanced to be that of the pretty waitingmaidto close his eyes and bring his perception into mutual sympathy with hers which is a peculiarly delicate cerebral voltaic volitional vital act and the condition for enjoying the play was complete then the pretty waitingmaidwho as has been already intimated was also a distinguished chemicophysiolobiologisteretired within her inner consciousness but with one handso to speakon the door of that department of her memory which was labelled macbeth shakespeare english ready to let out the imprisoned images that is she went into hypnotic sleep to see the things which eye could not behold all present were apparently insensible soon flaxius heard the softest strangest sound which rose to a grand peal of exquisite music and then trembling sunk and quivered into a strange halffearful halffantastic witch melody like a forest through which flitted at intervalsever and anon inaudible or losta wild yet exquisite waltza butterfly in a thundercloud meanwhile there was perceptible all around a gradually developing rising and spreading scenery of barren moors with encircling rocks and mountains vast trees waving in the wailing winda torrent and with it all there was an indescribable mental general impression apart from what was seen or heard as of another mighty wind or spiritual opium disposing the beholder unto fascination ‘i have beheld many a magnificent mise en scène’ reflected flaxius ‘but never anything like this it would have been an artwonder of the world a century ago and it is only a mere familycharade and a game of pussinthecorner or proverb for people now they have mastered art beyond our wildest dreamsonly to despise it’ then the play went on improving at every pace as oakford became inspired rising in grandeur and beauty impressiveness and the subtle sorcery of more than mere skill the music became a marvellous opera of accompaniment in no excess yet mighty in effect while the scenery was that of nature in her grandest or most enchanting moods best of all was the acting in which the auditor seemed unto himself to be the one who spokeand so it rolled on to an end with a final finely accentuated biologicalcardiac pressure of the handsuch as in earlier ages would have ignorantly described as a fond squeezethe pretty waitingmaid awoke ‘you are a great artist’ said flaxius to oakford ‘so so i am far from being first or even great nor is it considered any great accomplishment among educated people nowadays to give such games in such style it is only our child’s play o master just as the performances of thespius sank in later ages to the level of the mob though they had improved in quality and you now understand that while we understand and practise art a hundred times better than our ancestors did we do not esteem it at one hundredth the part of its ancient value’ ‘i understand’ said flaxius ‘go to rome or greece’ pursued oakford ‘and you will see the colosseum and forum and parthenon and all the most celebrated buildings of antiquity restored in all their beauty but even the schoolchildren now regard them as mere curiosities illustrations of a barbarous pastpretty enough in their small naïve waybut mere savage trifles compared to the works of science why we could now do in a week all that egypt built or unbuilt in six thousand years and we have the fullest deepest secret of their art toothe very spirit of its spiritand don’t think so very much of it either ah you nineteenth century men wrote an awful lot of rubbish which they called criticism after it died out art began againtravelling a long way after science it is truebut ages in advance of where it had gone before all of the ruskins and taines of the last century look to us like ants toiling over lumps of sugar which they believed were mountains very industrious ants they were and good judges of white sugar too but not of real alps or himalayas of eternal snow’ ‘truly’ observed flaxius ‘there were a few even in their own time who began to suspect that human genius was not quite exhausted in the renaissance and also that there was better nutriment for man than the confectionery of pictures or the icedcake of a milan cathedral all very fine very fine indeed for weddings and christmastrees tempi passati well as nature is an artist i suspect that art after all has only begun afresh on a grander scale than ever’ ‘haec fabula docet’ wrote flaxius as usual on the proof ‘that all mankind are pretty generally mistaken in believing that certain habits prejudices customs usages modes and ideas in or according to which they and their fathers grew up are eternal and innate laws of human nature never to be removed for all things may be taken out of us even conceit by the corkscrew of time or the airpump of science and it is the most marvellous manifestation of the age that none foresee what a tremendous pop and what a stupendous outflowing of the champagne of genius there will be when the stopple shall be drawn from the final end or mouth of this century bottle ‘“it will not come in my time” said a young savant to me in the last generation when i told him that ere long cities would be lit by gas “’tis all very fine and perhaps possible but we shall not live to see it” and within five years after the city wherein he spake was illuminated as i had predicted friends the child is born unto whom ere death naught which i have here written will seem strange for he will have seen the better part or enough to make a proof with his own eyes ye may more safely say that a piece of wax can never be moulded into a certain form than declare what man or society will never be but what is most wondrous of all in that which i predict is that the spirit of the change is coming sooneven as a french revolution comes so suddenly upon those in power and who are the most learned in the signs of the times that they have not time to move their office furniture for the salts are all in solution the liquid will hold no more and ere long a voice or a book will precipitate the vast and brilliant crystals by sound or shock ‘for that is to be for which jesus christ most ardently longed and which is the one great theme of the new testament that a time will come when patriotism the tenderest ties of home the form and letter of formalised religion the great distinctions between poverty and wealth yea every harsher oppressive conventional law which is per se useless shall disappear in a grand cosmopolitan altruism at the very name of which timeserving petty fools now jibe and titter even as they sneered in ancient rome at the new christianity which is now coming again in the dazzling allglorious white cloud of science let them laugh that will and exalt their old idols crying that there is this and that which man will never do “upharsin is writ on the wall” ‘woe unto the false prophets who give tips for races be they on horses or politicians or religion’tis all onefor both the horse and the demagogue are doomed to pass away ‘woe unto those who live in the trash and rot and folly of gossip and fashion for their memory will stink in the ages to come ‘woe unto the jew and the yankee the greek and parsee the englishman and dutchman the great former of trusts and syndicates yea the promoter and swindler be he who he may for in the great future history of iniquity his name will not be forgotten ‘woe unto you who shall struggle in the last hour to maintain your cracked and decayed old creeds and wornout fads screaming that “they all agree perfectly with science which was sent to support and prove them” ‘yea woe to the old jerusalem which stoned the prophets for there shall not be left one stone upon another of all her ancient temples gamblingdens policyoffices stockexchanges lupanars or societynewspapers in human form or literal ‘woe unto jerusalem and finally woe unto myself for i too with all my small writing will be whirled away with the rest down the back entry of time into the gutter of semiforgetfulness to be carried away into the river of oblivion and rightly too for how would any of us of the present day seem among the glorious ones who are to come verily as a great divine once said of sinners or dissenters in heaven we should “look like pigs in a parlour” therefore let us all go in peaceand be thankful that there will be far better than we are to succeed us ‘but “if not impossible it is only possible at least it will not come in our time” cries all the world when science foretells these reforms of the future here i am reminded of what was once written by paul féval a muddled romanticist who however in his dunghill of rubbish had at times a pearl and he said when speaking of steam as applied to boats and railway trains ‘“it took many years before that learned and illustrious body the admiraltyla marine de l’étattook into consideration that force which repelled the wind and laughed at the strength of currents it is true that at the same time the academy professed the opinion that a velocity of ten leagues an hour on a railroad would stifle respiration in a man and kill all who would risk it yet it would be foolish to blame our marine or our academics for thisfor le monde est ainsi faitsuch is the world every progress afflicts some interest or irritates some vanity ‘“ancient wisdom said ‘if you doubt consider carefully’ modern wisdom cries ‘if you do not understand then hinder’ can we ever enumerate the men and ideas put to death in the name of the idiotic phantom whom sages call improbability ‘“horace said that the man must have had a heart triply clad with bronze who first on a frail plank dared all the terrors of a raging stream it is admirably true add to it that the sages of his time would have abused that man with all their might ‘“and yet in every age those men so wise still cast themselves in vain before the path on which humanity was bound to pass for spite their spite humanity marched on improbability grotesque scarecrow as it was recoiled with its fogs before the light miracles once declared impossible are now seen undisturbed in every street it was only forty years ago and now you may find men living on their ‘shares’ whose hands once tried to stop the march of steam and if another marvel should arise they would laugh at and abuse it crying cela ne se peut pas it is impossible to say now that anything is impossible a man should have not only a heart shielded by triple bronze but the tenfold skin of a jackass” ‘and we should consider all this when any one now dreams of the future for the true age of ease has only just begun certain chemical discoveries made of late years have drawn from all intelligent men of science the opinion that we are advancing very rapidly indeed to a cheap wholesale production of all scents and flavours in perfection this means very cheap food of every taste to suit or the enjoyment of all delicaciesmere imagination or association being set aside hereinall consequences being consideredis something stupendous since enjoyment of taste in food is one of the greatest factors in life and a great stimulant to industry when this shall be somewhat relieved industry will be more at leisure and liberty to devote itself to higher things “it may be that the chinaman of the future will run the machines which the aryan will invent”’ 16 since this chapter was written i have observed that a great prophet w w astor the author of looking backwards noticed this same want of chimneys in the future the evanishment of flaxius ‘she came in her beauty bright as day to where in his sleep her true knight lay she held in her small and lightbright hand a plaything a brilliant moongold band she wound it about his hair and her own still singing the while “we two are one” all round them the world lay poor and dim aloft in her glory she rose with him they stood in a garden fair and bright the angels do call it “land of light”’ aslauga’s knight by la motte fouqué when time had worn away long centuries and a sweet spirit more subdued and soft had breathed a deeper love and gentleness into the heart of man as culture grew and ruder errors had been cast aside among traditions of the suffering ages flaxius sat alone before the rocky palace far away in the remotest recesses of the northern apennines it was a blest and fairyhallowed spot where in the stillness of the golden eve amid the rustling leaves and dewy grass he heard the solo or the chorus sweet of airy voices locked in unison faint faroff near deep solemn gay or sweet as if serenading the rising stars as they came one by one to the windows of heaven but it nowise disturbed his reverie for he was reviewing as he had seldom done all his life he had a stupendous memory and an allembracing perception with an immense power of concentration of mental force such as will some day be taught in schools when men shall be wise enough to examine and seek into truths set before them instead of manifesting their petty vanity by ridicule as with the spirit of a recent dream while all its forms still freshly haunt the soul the great lifepageant swept before his eyes dark forms forgotten for long centuries to man nor seen in art nor sketched in song a living stream of shadows strange and fair and images of great worldruling men and sages who had made deep laws of life and sent their power like an endless thrill beyond themfarinto eternity ‘it was to be yet it is wonderful’ thought the sage ‘and perhaps to me the more in wonder sweet since these fair forms that in long order glide still growing fairer as the world goes on were dimly and yet long ago foreseen true inductive prophecy began with science evolution first taught man how to evolve by a deeper logic than had e’er been known to schoolmen or the mere psychologist what was to come none the less wonderful to one who sees how a blind force with time has worked itself into a wondrous thinking deity’ ‘and the deity flaxius’ said a sweet voice in which there was the echo of a smile the fairy albinia was beside him ‘and the deity how dost thou behold it’ ‘what it will be is far beyond my view i know it wasnot even what it is god grows with all that god may greater be and awful is the mighty law of growth i know not why it is that all must grow because it is a law unto itself and slow indeed our growth is unto it’ ‘but in what form dost thou behold it now’ ‘i see it now in man and in what science showshow man will see it in the time to come is now full surely all unknown to man’ ‘and how didst thou discover god in man’ ‘even as plato saw it in the ideal which is the very soul and counterpart of the most real science may i speak’ ‘yes speak i feel my soul now speaks in thine’ ‘all nature types’ said flaxius ‘in ideals none ever yet beheld a perfect rose yet seeing many roses we infer what a true rose may be so in all things for nature never took a single form be it beautiful or base which had not an ideal never won and of all things there never was a form which in itself united the ideals as we behold them in the higher man ‘for indeed in the rose or in all flowers or in aught else there is no colour so beautiful as the living hue of a fair human being apart from sentiment of love the artist knows that that is the hardest of all hues to win and again as regards form no animal or plant or aught that lives combines such perfect outline strength and grace converging ever into an ideal no wonder that many have committed the error of looking to art more than to nature when we reflect how the artist feels this marvellous truth’ ‘and therefore it was well in its time flaxius that men worshipped art since it made them work unconsciously to a great end’ ‘yes it was well and glorious in its time’ replied flaxius ‘now it is rising to a higher aim but to resume there is no sound so sweet no power of modulation in all conceivable variety as is found in the human voice for it can breathe all passions fears and every phase of thought i say even thought though men class music with emotion only but to a higher sense all utterance is music given in a million forms yes man is the ideal of all ideals combined and ever tends to unite them in himself even by the common law which forms them all’ ‘this then my flaxius’ the fairy said ‘forms a new law that man shall gradually draw towards man as he perceives this truth what is religion’ ‘religion’ replied flaxius ‘is the sense of a higher power on which we must rely even as the child looks to the parent who is its ideal of all protection and authority to this is added wont or habit fixed which runs to second nature therefore man forms his tradition and adheres to it long after he has learned that other men are greater than the parents and this is the history of every creed on earth’ ‘and so the form still takes the place of truth yet still a form is indispensable’ ‘yes it must be because in forms we live’ said flaxius slowly ‘a wondrous truth which leads to constant war strange is the history of the ancient forms which one by one the world has cast aside therefore the egyptians typified the holy ghost or the allpervading spirit of life as a serpent which annually casts its skin and is renewed in brighter hues’ ‘and man must have a form to worship or incarnate the power which he adores’ ‘ay and it is to that which i would come the hebrews worshipped god in a fixed law sternly expressed a law immutable and this they had incarnate in a book this was their form from which they jealously excluded every trace of human shape because ’twas written that no living man could ever see the real form of god they worshipped god’s great voice that is to say the echo of it as expressed in law therefore when prophets spoke no more on earth they still retained a kind of fairy faith that the bath kol or echo of the voice was heard at times in a consecrated archi think ’twas in the temple now ’tis still it was all the conception of hebrew nature incarnate in an ideal man whom they called jehovah ‘then came the greeks who personified nature in all her forms and represented every passion or feeling as a deity they saw god in statues and felt religion in art ideals something they lost in vigorous early strength but gained a thousandfold in thought and grace they made a progress toward ideal man’ ‘and out of all a new religion grew’ replied the fairy in her sweetest voice ‘which was as far beyond the greek ideal as that had been beyond the hebrew law’ ‘yes’ answered flaxius in earnest tone ‘and could the real spirit of christianity as christ meant it have been combined with greek art and perception of natural beautyas the poor young emperor julian desiredhave been realised the world might have seen a wonderful religion but ’twas all for the best as now i truly see as fast as islands raised their sunny peaks above the blue sea and grew green and beautiful there came the barbarians in multitudes to settle on themin early times the hun and visigoth in later days the negro and chinesestruggling on struggling ever sweeping on and yet true culture gained upon it all’ ‘and thou see’st also flaxius’ said the fairy ‘that had the julian religion triumphed man might have lived so long in sweet content of art and love and pure humility and all the softness of his gentleness that vigour might have died and strength been gone progress needs strife’ ‘ay and more than that’ added flaxius ‘those barbarian struggles gave the strength to man which was needed to create science which in due time raised up a higher art and then revived the christian dream of love in altruism fed with greater force it all led to nobler ideals’ ‘and religion’ ‘religion from awe and fear became love mingled with reverencereverence before the mighty mystery of power hidden in man himself after the greek worship of statues came the pictureworship of the renaissance and then another age of confusion and the warring of new elements and the death of the old art ‘now the ideal is in man himself and the world instead of books or statues or pictures cultivates humanity and sees divinity in itself in a new ideal this is the most advanced exponent of the mystery of power even of old when any man loved he began by making the utmost of the loved one or the pair did so mutually it is touching to read in every fond romance and every poem of the ancient times in myriads of novels and letters how they all began with the elements of true worship each hoped to find in the other something which would ennoble transfigure them to another or a higher life and they were in the right and in all cases it might have been had they known how to persevere in it but outer influences were too strong while their perception of the truth was weak ‘what is the power of the vast unknown which circles through all space and gives us life or how it lives in us or what it isa spirit or a force which gives itself unto itself a consciousness in usis a great mystery beyond our ken but this we have learned after long centuries that he who wills can win so much of it by ever striving unto pure ideals and pressing steadfastly unto the great that he can win himself tremendous power aided therein by love and mutual will’ ‘now art thou coming to the highest truth’ ‘ay such a truth as hath no counterpart for if two people love in very truth seeing in one another the highest ideal of the will or the possible power of becoming what they will and each strives in all things to be perfect to the otherthen will they worship god in very truth for if thou canst maintain in me high selfrespect and i in thee we make a wondrous power in ourselves which well maintained may rise to miracle for this i do believe in very truth that love alone can make our souls divine and when we do believe in very truth that we are the ideal form of god or holy pictures of the highest power or living laws or bibles and if we do carry out the laws therein expressed it is in us to win such wondrous might as magic claimed in ages long gone by for this we need no other higher aid than mutual love and will which well maintained will raise us ever to a nobler life all men who love live in a fairyland and all who will may aye remain in it if they will make their love the law of life believing truly that they are divine or growing in divinity and hope ‘and they who believe in very truth and faith that each is holythat the almighty power though but a spark dwells in them and that it may grow into a flame and hold to this as they perhaps have held to some old creed or tattered form which never held a truthwill know what ’tis to be divine ‘yet now and then we all have transient views when standing by the rushing flood of life that there is in it force and light unknown “those eddying balls of foam those arrowy gleams that o’er the pavement of the surging streams welter and flash” are glimpses of the truth which understood might give new life to thee ‘i do not say that this can only be between a man and a woman when they love because if we believe that all mankind do form the archideals of the worldthat is by more or less as they are formedthen i can see how step by step all men will become links in this true golden chainthe aurea catena of which of yore pythagoras once dreamed the chain which binds the highest with the lowest all in one ‘so have i loved thee o my golden one since the old days of the etruscan age so shall i love thee through eternity while different we were yet ever one in truth and ever nearing as the time went on ‘and now my heart is filled with earth and i have seen it to its glorious heritage and know ’twill soon be heaven therefore i my mission ended and my task complete will join thee in thy life and never part i know that heaven is in love and thee’ and as he said this word the fairy smiled and wound her arms about him and a light as of a rainbow of the brightest hues blended with music quaint and wildly sweetthe spirit of the dream of olden timecame over them and hid them from my sight but when it vanished both of them were gone and flaxius was seen on earth no more ‘but what of god’ asked the fairy as they sat in elf elysium amid shadows of perfumed foliage by dancing rivulets where all was like the best and most beautiful on earth rising to higher and more glorious form for thou hast shown how by love and finding ideals in one another we can refine and exalt our nature yet that is not religion’ ‘i will tell thee what i believed on earth’ answered the sage ‘and i think i shall not change my faith though i rise far beyond this life of beauty ‘when men believed in spirit and matter as separate all was confusion and void and the wisest went unwittingly wandering about from error to error like lost souls seeking in eternal darkness one mocking ignis fatuus after the other then after years of study i perceived that all must be matter alone visible to my senses it is true but also refined in infinite forms beyond all human sensual or sensitive perception for all that poets and supernaturalists have ever imagined spirit to be is outdone in fineness by what science is boldly suggesting and proving ‘as there are in nature extraordinary or extravagant exaggerations of the powers of the senses as is seen in vultures which can perceive a small object a hundred miles away so there are as likely other senses not known to man other dimensions which he cannot understand and forms of matter which he cannot perceive by “sense” this is no idle conjecture every new experiment in a laboratory every discovery makes it more probable a few years ago or within sixty years man seemed to be in blind ignorance comparing what he then knew with what he has learned this is even more evident from the revelations of hitherto unknown forces the fact that light is not per se but the impression made on us therefore there may be worlds unseen in infinite number and series and existences or intelligences of incalculable or infinite power there may be a god whose existence has a reason for being according to materialism but none whatever in a spiritual a priori faith founded on and supported only by mere tradition ‘but what does man know in full or in truth if we take the simplest problem in naturethe sprouting of a bean all the wisdom of all time cannot explain why it is that it grows up a beanvine through the ages ever renewing itself to suppose that there are infinite millions of concentrated vines or germs in every bean is absurd or if true it only increases the marvel therefore an idea or subject once formed must be the coalescence of certain forms of matter with certain laws according to which certain material is attracted or thrown off for ever like being drawn to like but oh how infinitely beyond human knowledge or perception is the fulness of this least of natural problems ‘and there are millions of creations deeper and deeper all calling forth in every phase admiration for the infinite ingenuity and adaptation which are revealed in every creation observe the ant which by instinct alone as we call it can execute tasks and problems in architecture a thousand times more difficult than any which man has ever achieved what it all means is this that beyond and out of our small mental system with its distinctions between understanding and reason and selfconsciousness and “i am”which is all much more mechanical and akin to atavism and mere instinct than we imaginethere is a stupendous power of creation with an infinite amount of what we gladly call thought or mind when we develop a similar ingenuity and in fact it is amusing that men who consider that a very little discovery of the laws of nature is the greatest proof of their having intellect should doubt that intellect of a kind unknown to us is the creator of it all ‘now what exists in the realms unknown to sense no one can say but that there are intelligences who exert ingenuity and power in creation is palpable enough as the bean proves therefore a series of beings and gods or a god is an inevitable deduction ‘it is also proved by science that the human will can be so incredibly developed by a certain training and discipline within the reach of all and very easy that we may control our tempers our desires or increase our determination to a miraculous extent16 this too is all a result of modern physical science or “mere materialism” and it has done more to establish pure morality and a wellbased belief in god than all that psychology ever imagined for like the rational faith in god it is a direct result of evolution ‘the result of the two deductions is that directing the developed will towards god with all our heart or towards love in sincerity and zeal we arrive at all true religion and possible happiness for the pure will independent and free and marvellous in power must coexist with altruism which is the kernel of christianity love god and man for to be free we must coordinate with moral law and what this is we learn by the experience of life every man according to his measure and allowance we should all do well enough if we all did as well as we could never minding the quibbles of wouldbe lawgivers ‘all magic and what man regards as spiritual or transcendental learning and theosophy and soulwisdom is embraced in perfect belief in and reliance on god and action of our developed will all that mystics and theosophists have written amounts to no more than this believe in god and in thine own will aided by god ‘“god helps those who help themselves” is a great truth to be ever borne in mind nay so true that nearly all prayer is mere idle ceremony and of small avail however fervent it may be if there be no will exerted no energetic effort to be and do good by those who are capable of effort for the creator himself is ever working by evolution who shall say that even omnipotence like thor does not do battle with ere it conquer the stupendous jötuns or barbarous giants of brute forces in nature or the “downwardborne elements of god” as hermes trismegistus called them ‘as creation is the will of god realised in action so the will of man vigorously exerted is responded to by the divine demiurgus therefore prayer should be will and will prayer which may be fully apparent in time though perhaps not at first ‘what is most to be considered above all earthly interests and desires or human wants or ideas is the illimitable stupendous and glorious power and nature of god here evolution has lifted man far above all that the most inspired prophets or bards of judæa or egypt or india ever conceived for they were limited to what was apparent to the senses and indeed to this world as the only one but to him who actually understands that there are twenty million suns with solar systems and so on for ever and that it is probable as paracelsus so strangely guessed that there are races and worlds to us invisible and intangible living as it were through and in this life the creator must be more than he ever was even to moses ‘now the more the stupendous original creative power of god is felt the more capable do we become of realisingthat is rising to and drawing near unto him by so doing shall we understand that all was made in and by and for him as the only one and not for us before this awful and glorious truth all other considerations should vanish for his will should be allhe is the master and the lord for ever ‘all who believe this will desire to do good work for its own sake and create that which shall in the future be developed into greater good rather than seek for pay or reward which latter may be left to god or unseen divine agents who know better than we do what we need and who do aid the true servitors of god ‘the true servitor is the one who lives in the infinite power goodness and glory of god who exerts his own will and strength or effort to the utmost to do and to be good and whose devotion consists not so much in mere praying or begging for alms instead of trying to earn wages as of recognition of his omnipotence ‘yes if it be god’s will that i should pass away into nothingness then would i prefer it to the most blissful immortality without his desire for what am i before him save his creation from nothing born to obey and so far from thinking that such want of a future releases man from moral obligations i hold that such a faith is the highest stimulus to do our best while we live and avoid all sin ‘therefore o man trouble not thyself as to a future so that thou lovest and obeyest god and treatest man as another self and livest thy utmost mental life in will and prayer for unto him whose prayer is will and will is prayer all may be granted ‘and remember that there is nothing taught more explicitly in the new testament than that man should commune directly with god without aid or intervention chiefly by worship and by using his will in every way to that end ‘in very truthvicisti galilæe thou hast conquered o christ’ 17 vide have you a strong will etc by charles godfrey leland london philip wellby breitmann’s last ballad there was once an american hodgepodge comic melodrama of a kind now passed awayin which there was heard from time to time ‘one warning trumpet blown’ behind the scenes for no assignable reason ‘save to heighten the effect’ this it invariably did and especially after the curtain had fallen when the clarion notes were heard as an encore even so has it been with breitmann in this book and so at the end doth he sound farewell as follows speaking from his very heart as to the war breitmann on the
