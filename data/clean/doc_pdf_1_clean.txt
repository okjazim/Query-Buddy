furtherance of its statutory responsibilities under the federal information security management act fisma of 2002 public law 107 347 nist is responsible for developing standards and guidelines including minimum requirements for providing adequate information security for all agency operations and assets but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security systems this guideline is consistent with the requirements of the office of management and budget omb circular a 130 section 8b3 “securing agency information systems” as analyzed in a 130 appendix iv analysis of key sections supplemental information is provided in a 130 appendix iii this guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies it may be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright though attribution is desired nothing in this document should be taken to contradict sta ndards and guidelines made mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the secretary of commerce under statutory authority nor should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the secretary of commerce direct or of the omb or any other federal official 12 purpose and scope cloud computing is an evolving paradigm the nist definition characterizes important aspects of cloud computing and is intended to serve as a means for broad comparisons of cloud services and deployment strategies and to provide a baseline for discussion from what is cloud computing to how to best use cloud computing the service and deployment models defined form a simple taxonomy that is not intended to prescribe or constrain any particula r method of deployment service delivery or business operation 13 audience the intended audience of this document is system planners program managers technologists and others adopting cloud computing as consumers or providers of cloud services 2 2 the nis t definition of cloud computing cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous convenient on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources eg networks servers storage applications and services that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction this cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics three service models and four deployment models essential characteristics ondemand self service a consumer can unilaterally provision computing c apabilities such as server time and network storage as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider broad network access capabilities are available over the networ k and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms eg mobile phones tablets laptops and workstations resource pooling the provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consume rs using a multi tenant model with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand there is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exa ct location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction eg country state or datacenter examples of resources include storage processing memory and network bandwidth rapid elasticity capabiliti es can be elastically provisioned and released in some cases automatically to scale rapidly out ward and in ward commensurate with demand to the consumer the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time measured service cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability 1 at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service eg storage processing bandwidth and active user accounts resource usage can be monitored controlled and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service service models software as a s ervice saas the capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider’s applications running on a cloud infrastructure2 the applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface such as a web browser eg webbased email or a program interface the consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network servers operating systems storage or even individual application capabilities with the possible exception of limited user specific application configuration settings platform as a servic e paas the capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer created or acquired applications created using programming 1 typically this is done on a pay peruse or chargeper use basis 2 a cloud infrastructure is the collection of hardware and software that enables the five essential characteristics of cloud computing the cloud infrast ructure can be viewed as containing both a physical layer and an abstraction layer the physical layer consists of the hardware resources that are necessary to support the cloud services being provided and typically includes server storage and network co mponents the abstraction layer consists of the software deployed across the physical layer which manifests the essential cloud characteristics conceptually the abstraction layer sits above the physical layer 3 languages libraries services and tools supported by the provider3 the consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network servers operating systems or storage but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application hosting environment infrastructur e as a service iaas the capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing storage networks and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software which can include operating systems and applications the consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems storage and deployed applications and possibly limited control of select networking components eg host firewalls deployment models private cloud the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consu mers eg business units it may be owned managed and operated by the organization a third party or some combi nation of them and it may exist on or off premise s community cloud the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns eg mission security requirements policy and compliance considerations it may be owned managed and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community a third party or some combination of them and it may exist on or off premises public cloud the cloud infrastructure is provisi oned for open use by the general public it may be owned managed and operated by a business academic or government organization or some combination of them it exists on the premises of the cloud provider hybrid cloud the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructure s private community or public that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability eg cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds 3 this capability does not necessarily preclude the use of compatible programming languages libraries services and tools from other sources
