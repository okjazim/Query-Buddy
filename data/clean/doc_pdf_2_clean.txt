frietsch simone kimpeler henning kroll christian lerch thomas reiss florian roth torben schubert johanna schuler rainer walz karlsruhe germany july 2020 wwwisifraunhoferdeexecutive summary background and motivation calls for technology sovereignty in europe were becoming louder even before the current corona crisis growing geopolitical uncertainties and the threat of global trade conflicts are questioning the optimism of recent decades concerning the interdependence of our economies in germany this is triggering a discussion about how independent a state or a federation of states must and can be with regard to critical technologies it becomes clear that there is an increasing conflict between the call for technology sovereignty on the one hand and the dominant economic model on the other in which global specialization and the division of labor combined with open trade increases the welfare of all germany in particu lar as an export nation and the eu as an economic area must consider the ques tion of technology sovereignty carefully and in a differentiated manner we present one conception of technology sovereignty in this position paper our intention is to enrich the current debate and improve differentiation we develop the criteria and key analytical steps needed to determine the criticality of technologies and the degree of technology sovereignty building on this we develop modified strategies to safeguard or to produce technology sovereignty 2 3what is technology sovereignty we define technology sovereignty as the ability of a state or a federation of states to provide the technologies it deems critical for its welfare competitive ness and ability to act and to be able to develop these or source them from other eco nomic areas without onesided structural dependency our definition of technology sovereignty therefore does not imply comprehensive technology autarky that questions the international division of labor and global ization and aims at providing every technology classified as critical primarily it describes preserving options by developing and maintaining own capabilities and avoiding onesided dependencies technology sovereignty is therefore a neces sary but by no means sufficient condition for the selfdetermined creation and diffusion of critical innovations innovation sovereignty and therefore for self determined economic trade economic sovereignty it is insufficient to focus on technology sovereignty alone wwwisifraunhoferde how do we determine whether technology sovereignty exists and whether we should pursue it analytical steps while from the viewpoint of the state the aim is often to achieve technological competitiveness in as many areas as possible we propose a more differentiated and selective approach to determining whether sovereignty exists or is indeed required for a specific technology the first step is to analyze whether a technology is currently critical meaning indispensable or will be critical in future and why and to what extent access to it could be threatened by external shocks the second step is to differentiate precisely in which functional context a technology is critical here we distinguish between a technology’s contribution to economic competitiveness its contribution to meeting key societal needs such as healthcare for example or energy supply and to sovereign tasks this distinction is import ant because it determines whether and for what precisely a particular technology is absolutely indispensable and whether there may be functional substitutes that elimi nate dependence on a specific technology the third step is to define the appropriate spatialpolitical system boundaries within which technology sovereignty should be achieved the degree of economic and political interdependence determines the security of supply as well as the degree of dependency on actors outside the system for germany this frame of reference should in principle be the eu in view of the manifold existing economic institutional and political interdependencies in the final step we consider the factors needed to produce technology sovereignty we distinguish here between already existing own competencies and resources or the possibility to develop the necessary competencies and resources ourselves if needed and access to resources competencies and upstream services of third parties security of supply constraints on technology sovereignty are to be feared if there is no security of supply from third parties for those 4 5critical resources or competencies that a state or a federation of states cannot provide or develop itself the joint analysis of these dimensions can determine the current and the desirable degree of technology sovereignty in a given situation and where needed strategies can be developed to preserve or to generate technology sovereignty a systemic perspective must always be taken here in order to comprehensively assess and develop both resilience to shocks and adaptability in a dynamic global environment methods and data sources a series of analytical steps are needed to develop strategies to preserve or produce technology sovereignty our position paper presents various methods and data sources for these steps to gain a better understanding of our own compe tencies and resources the methods range from patent and publication analyses through analyses of standardization activities to trade statistics grouped and analyzed by tech nology concerning the dependence on other countries or access to the resources and competencies of other countries the analyses include data sources such as technologyspecific trade statistics complexity indices to identify value chains and information about the governance behavior of countries based for instance on wto compliance analyses or the world governance index we use two case examples in our position paper – 5g tech nologies and industry 40 robotics – to illustrate how the concept can be applied and used to define modified strate gies that go beyond the current debate wwwisifraunhoferde how can technology sovereignty be produced and preserved strategic recommendations the position paper’s first general recommended strategy is to provide the competencies for the complex analysis to deter mine the necessity of technology sovereignty and to develop the necessary methods this is a prerequisite to developing modified strategies to produce and preserve technology sovereignty it must remain clear at all times that technology sovereignty is a necessary but not sufficient condition for innovations which ensure economic competitiveness and that society’s needs are met the consideration of technology sovereignty must supplement and cannot replace what is required of a futureoriented innovation policy the concrete recommended strategies comprise a number of actions sufficiently broad investments in research and develop ment are the basic prerequisite for establishing sover eignty in critical technologies now and in the future any reduction of existing rd competencies that are currently used or could easily be mobilized in areas where there is a threat of dependence on third parties should be avoided international research cooperation and technology partnerships are an important instrument for mobilizing complementary competencies and achieving technology interdependence with other selected countries by means of knowledge interdependencies thus reducing onesided dependency on third parties actively influencing standards to direct international markets towards our own technologies as well as patent pools or open source software and hardware which pre vent monopolization and thus structural dependencies creating regulatory framework conditions in critical tech nology fields that foster innovation and production promoting innovationoriented procurement that pro vides our own companies with the necessary incentives to invest in critical technologies strengthening international organizations such as the wto to ensure compliance with agreed multilateral 6 7regulations as much as possible despite global trade conflicts this is important since in addition to the single european market free world trade with its strong compe tition incentives remains an important boundary condition for technology sovereignty the concept of technology sovereignty is also congruent with increased investment in the resilience of the eu’s economic and social systems so that these can recover rapidly from shocks and disruptions and adapt quickly to changing con texts this is an important cornerstone of any consideration of futureproof technology sovereignty the eu states already have the right prerequisites for this as their economies are strongly oriented towards open competition and their societ ies are influenced by subsidiarity and above all are demo cratically organized all this means the eu’s ability to adapt is fed by a diverse pool of economic political scientific and civil society resources fostering the broadest possible basis of competencies and capacities in critical technology fields is an important element in lowering the vulnerability of the eu to potential disruptions and shocks – especially in times of increasing global uncertainty in line with a systemic approach to resilience key technological abilities should therefore be promoted innovation networks built and experimental learn ing enabled for example in regulatory sandboxes 8 9introduction during the course of the coronavirus crisis it has been increasingly pointed out that a country needs to be able to provide its population with essential supplies using its own domestic capacities in order to avoid dependencies on other coun tries it is argued that in the event of a crisis states or federations of states must be able to provide or produce in their own countries the infrastructures services and products eg medicines needed for society and the economy and for carry ing out their own public tasks and must have the appropriate technologies and sufficient research capacities for innovative solutions this aspiration is linked to a demand that was already experiencing a renaissance in the eu and in germany even before the corona crisis namely to actively expand one’s own technology sovereignty we define technology sovereignty as the ability of a state or a federation of states to provide the technologies it deems critical for welfare competitiveness and its ability to act and to be able to develop these or source them from other economic areas without onesided structural dependency the discussion about technology sovereignty at european lev el is determining the debate both in terms of the priorities in the new framework programme as well as european industry and digital strategies in addition it forms a key component of the discussion on how to overcome the corona crisis in europe1 federal minister for economic affairs and energy peter altmaier and industry associations2 have put technology sovereignty back on the agenda in the context of germany’s industrial strategy as well at present the most intensive dis cussions about sovereignty are taking place in the technology fields of vaccine development 5g technology infrastructure and artificial intelligence3 these are considered critical tech nologies that not only generate huge markets for themselves worldwide but also act as key technologies for almost all industrial and service sectors they are pivotal to fulfilling sov ereign tasks in terms of providing public services such as civil security healthcare energy and transport infrastructures in view of the current coronavirus pandemic this also concerns mobilizing sufficient research capacities and generating tech nologies at home in order to be able to contain the spread and impacts of the virus using protective measures innova tive treatments and medication here it is essential to have technologies available to maintain important economic and social activities that are restricted by the virus however the concepts and interpretations of technology sov ereignty vary depending on economic and political interests in order to support innovation policy a more differentiated analysis is required of the area of potential conflict between global trade integrated value chains and technology and knowledge transfer on the one hand and the need for state sovereignty on the other with this position paper we would like to provide a con ceptual basis for the debate and offer an invitation to an informed dialogue we argue that in view of global chal lenges such as climate change or pandemics closely inter connected value chains and geopolitical uncertainties only a consistently european perspective of technology sovereignty is futureproof the integration of value added in the euro wwwisifraunhoferdepean single market and the positioning visàvis the increas ingly protectionist usa and china makes the national level within the eu appear insufficient even counterproductive for producing technology sovereignty if only because of the size differences our concept of technology sovereignty is characterized by a degree of differentiation that goes beyond the current often politically driven discussion we place technology sovereignty in the wider context of economic and innovation sovereign ty in addition we distinguish the various functions that technologies fulfill in government society and the economy and based on this propose criteria and methods able to determine the need for and degree of european sovereignty in terms of key technologies we formulate recommended strategies to avoid onesided dependencies in technologies classified as critical and to strengthen the resilience of eu member states to external shocks we illustrate our concept using two case examples – 5g technologies and industry 40 robotics – before we close the paper by summarizing several core statements economic sovereignty sovereignty in the performance of public duties innovation sovereignty technology sovereignty 10 11what is technology sovereignty at its core the term technology sovereignty describes the ability to generate scientifictechnological knowledge either autonomously or to be able to access such in stable partnerships without constraints technology sovereignty does not imply comprehensive technology autarky that calls into question the international division of labor or globalization and strives to provide every technology classified as critical primarily it describes preserving options by developing and maintain ing own capabilities and avoiding onesided dependencies to start with the concept of technology sovereignty must be distinguished from the broader concepts of innovation sover eignty and economic sovereignty see figure 1 we can describe economic sovereignty as the ability to generate value added and prosperity through independent activities or through a mutual exchange with other economic regions without becoming unilaterally dependent on external actors in a similar way this applies to the original sovereign tasks and to the independent provision of public services by both private and state actors economic sovereignty and sovereignty in performing public tasks are traditionally based on the need for unimpeded access to natural resources and capital by relevant actors and unimpeded access to technolo gies innovations competencies and datain the efforts made by economic innovation and technology policies to establish economic sovereignty there is a growing interest in technology sovereignty alongside the exploitation of raw materials and the advantageous positioning of eco nomic actors in global production and value chains4 technology sovereignty plays a special role in the bigger picture of state sovereignty because it enables economic sov ereignty and autonomous state actions over and over again and because it is in itself renewable in contrast to resource stocks for example in modern globally networked economies value creation and welfare as well as guaranteeing public services are based on innovations being generated and widely applied innovations figure 1 technology sovereignty as part of innovation and economic sovereignty wwwisifraunhoferdein turn depend on being able to generate the technolog ical basis for current and future economic activities locally scientific technological competencies and qualifications or to obtain these from reliable partners application compe tence however scientifictechnological competencies on their own have no effect and are without relevance for the innovation sovereignty of germany and the eu unless the abilities need ed to exploit technological insights are also available and the necessary system prerequisites exist such as the required infrastructures production capacities regulatory framework conditions etc technology sovereignty is therefore a necessary but by no means sufficient basis for achieving innovation sovereignty in turn such innovation sovereignty is indispensable but not sufficient for achieving widerranging economic sovereignty this applies equally to the sovereignty in guaranteeing public services that also depends on other criteria such as access to competencies capital and resources see figure 1 the concept of technology sovereignty introduced here does not aim at a general expansion of technological activities in fields in which our own international competitiveness is perceived as too low or as capable of being developed while from a state’s perspective efforts are often made to achieve technological competitiveness in as many fields as possible the search for technology sovereignty is usually in selected fields that are considered particularly important according to criteria that will be defined in the following subsection5 technology functions and rationales three functions of technologies can be differentiated to de termine when a technology is classified as critical for a state or a federation of states see table 1 safeguarding the original sovereign tasks that govern ment bodies perform by using the available technologies eg civil security defense administration meeting the needs of society eg food shelter energy and water mobility communications health on the one hand satisfying basic social needs through public services such as healthcare or supplying – partially critical – infra structures on the other hand in regard to changes that are mainly initiated and controlled by government such as targeted sociotechnical transformations eg the ener gy transition transformation of mobility ensuring the medium and longterm success of a national economy and its technological competitiveness which is mainly supported by private actors although this can be substantially shaped by state support and financing legitimate reasons to pursue technology sovereignty result from all three functions while the state’s ability to act in the domain of original sovereign tasks constitutes the most direct representation of the necessity for technology sovereignty meeting the needs of society and technological competitive ness are also dependent on the unimpeded access of the actors of a state of a federation of states to a broad portfolio of technologies and development competencies the transition between these three bundles of functions and rationales is fluid and often not sharply delineated techno logical competencies that represent options today and are therefore more relevant for technological competitiveness can become fundamental for the fulfillment of social needs and sovereign tasks in the short term nevertheless separating these rationales is useful – if not essential – to establish a convincing context for political justification 12 13table 1 typology of the dimensions of need for technology sovereigntytechnology sovereignty original sovereign tasksmeeting needs of societyeconomic competitiveness preserve and

energy transitioncreation and renewal of paths transform and develop new sectors emobility industry 40 static dynamic and reactive technology sovereignty different goals for producing or preserving technology sover eignty can therefore be distinguished in addition to the above described differentiation of the rationales see table 1 preserving or protecting current technology sovereignty with the goal of obtaining an advantageous position in global in novation and value creation chains and guaranteeing state sovereign functions and public services based on existing competencies and resources of managing crises using own resources and thus ensuring that the european economic and innovation system is crisisproof resilient this resilience and adaptability to foreseeable and unforeseen disruptions and crises is becoming increasingly important for european societies in view of developments that are perceived as dangerous the risk of system failures is also becoming more and more relevant with the grow ing dependency on increasingly complex technical systems for example power supply or it networks in addition natural catastrophes such as earthquakes the increasing prevalence of floods and droughts due to climate change pandemics or protectionist and ag gressive trade policy developments in the international political environment pose increasing threats to the economy and society dynamic development of technology sovereignty with the goal of assuming an active formative role in evolving processes and development pathways to proactively shape future developments 14 15criteria to determine the importance of technologies and access to them importance and types of criteria empirically determining to what extent technology sovereign ty exists for a specific state or federation of states and a spe cific technology countrytechnology combination requires the analysis of two interconnected questions 1 within which system boundaries is technology sover eignty aspired to 2 what are the factors influencing technology sov ereignty and how are they expressed in a concrete caseanalyzing the system boundaries question 1 is an important step to understanding whether a certain technology requires more detailed consideration and perhaps political measures to ensure technology sovereignty it is necessary to define cri teria to assess the technological economic legal institution al and political framework conditions an indepth analysis of the degree of technological sovereignty is only necessary for those technologies classified as critical after analyzing the system boundaries question 2 criteria for system boundaries three different dimensions can be distinguished in the discus sion of system boundaries the spatialpolitical dimension ie the geographical and political frame of reference for technology sovereignty the functional dimension of the analyzed services or goods for which technology sovereignty is to be aimed at in principle and which we differentiated into sovereign tasks social needs and economic competitiveness in the first step above the time dimension which distinguishes shortterm supply bottlenecks from structural dependencies three additional subcriteria are applied when determining the spatialpolitical area to which technology sovereignty should apply the degree of political integration as a rule the more advanced this is the more institutionalized coordination mechanisms are that aim at a free exchange of technolo gies the degree of economic integration the more advanced this is for instance with regard to value chains or corpo rate ownership control the less likely and even impossible it becomes to decouple individual politicalgeographical areas shared culture and value set if for example an economic region shares the model of an open society or has social and political common ground such as a democratic state constitution with the separation of powers the likelihood tends to be low that individual actors will deliberately use dependencies to reduce the technology sovereignty of other actors wwwisifraunhoferdewhereas the temporal and functional dimensions should be analyzed and decided on a case by case basis a general estimation can be made for the spatialgeographic dimension of germany its spatialpolitical integration within the eu is particularly strong there are clear rules with the single mar ket in addition there are numerous competencies regarding foreign trade issues at eu level this degree of political inte gration makes politically induced disruptions to value chains and knowledge flows seem very unlikely mutual economic interdependencies and the european countries’ common sociopolitical model also favor the “eu” political level this is all the more valid since a national frame of reference for technology sovereignty would create its own necessity as corresponding national efforts would undermine confidence in the interdependencies and mutual obligations within the eu this would contribute to a dynamic of renationalization that cannot be in the interests of the technology sovereignty of the member states as a whole however such an approach could and should be adaptable to any changes in the level of interdependencies within the eu over time starting from the eu as the region of analysis the criticality of access to technologies outside the eu is assessed this is indicated by the frequency and intensity of trade conflicts and violations of wto rules by individual countries another indi cation is the existence of trade agreements as these guaran tee a certain degree of stability in economic and knowledge relations especially the existence of bilateral trade agree ments with countries that have similar cultural sociopolitical or economic models eg canada or japan could result in otherwise essential technologies being classified as less prob lematic access here would be ensured with a certain degree of reliability we refer to the categories introduced in the chapter “tech nology functions and rationales” for technology sovereignty aimed at supplying the following functional areas technologies for maintaining the original sovereign functions of a state ensuring public services ensuring the medium and longterm success of a national economy and its technological competitiveness criteria along the time dimension are needed to distinguish shortterm supply and delivery bottlenecks from those related to structural technology sovereignty for example in the con text of the corona crisis shortterm delivery problems for cer tain goods like face masks or toilet paper were also addressed as dependency problems we believe a demarcation is needed here in terms of our concept technology sovereignty refers to at least a medium time horizon eg six months to ten years shorterterm dependencies can be counteracted eg by improved stockkeeping in a very longterm perspective numerous new technological competencies can be devel oped on the other hand there is the risk of mediumterm dependencies becoming locked in if path dependencies exist which can then only be addressed by accepting extremely high conversion costs criteria to determine the degree of technology sovereignty for the criteria to determine the degree of technology sover eignty a distinction must be made between various subcrite ria that influence technology sovereignty in different ways technology sovereignty is high if the technology is produced within a country’s own politicalgeographical domain or the ability to produce it exists in cases where technologies are not produced in a country’s own politicalgeographical domain but can be obtained without restriction from outside it factors should be considered that increase the risk of access to the technologies being limited or refused corresponding factors are required that describe these supply risks supply risks are reduced if technological alternatives sub stitutes are available these also have a disciplinary effect on the exertion of market power by a supply concentra tion the existence of mutual dependencies has a similar effect 16 17ability to produce the technology in the home country if a technology is already produced in the home country it can usually be assumed that it will also be available locally in the future however even in this case the condition must be satisfied that the required components remain available and that access to critical input factors continues to be given this makes it clear that assessing technology sovereignty may not be limited to the final product alone but must consider the entire associated value chain a high degree of technology sovereignty exists even if initially only the abilities to start production in the short to medium term are available the ability to produce a certain technolo gy presupposes knowledge and access to other critical input factors technological knowhow can be mapped using eg technol ogyspecific patent indicators that show technological perfor mance see infobox however this also requires the existence of economic actors who can apply this knowledge ultimate ly any assessment of ability also necessitates assessing the performance of the corresponding technological innovation system criteria for supply risks for technologies obtained from abroad for cases in which the relevant technologies are only available outside the analyzed geographicalpolitical area factors must be considered that increase the risk that the technology can no longer be accessed for economic political or other reasons eg climate events political instability pandemics this risk of access restrictions increases with increasing sup plier concentration because this raises their market power on the one hand and reduces the scope for switching to other supplier countries should access be restricted to estimate the risk of losing access to resources and technologies it is important to regularly analyze indicators such as eg the herfindahl hirschman index which can be used to measure this kind of supplier concentration in addition to supply concentration the reliability of the sup plier countries also plays an important role important factors here include political and social stability compliance with legal regulations and the absence of corruption for example the eu assesses countries supplying critical raw materials with the help of the world governance indicator and the underlying database of the world bank6 the degree of mutual depen dency must also be examined mutual dependency exists to the extent to which a supplier is itself dependent on the country it refuses to supply this reduces the risk of onesided deliberate supply restrictions trade statistics on the flow of goods an analysis of the compliance of individual countries with wto regulations or the economic complexity index7 on production capacities can provide important information here existence of possible substitutes supply risks are reduced and technology sovereignty increas es if technological alternatives substitutes to the analyzed technology are available or foreseeable technological feasibility is one criterion for the existence of a substitution alternative in this context the first thing is to as sess whether there are any relevant approaches in the home country in the medium term patent analyses and periodical systematic expert surveys can provide indications of this this includes assessing whether the relevant possibilities make economic sense finally it is essential that substitutes are also potentially available or must be created within the home country ultimately this means that the above listed criteria must then also be applied to the substitution options criteria to assess technology sovereignty overall it becomes clear that several criteria need to be combined to assess the degree of technology sovereignty these include quantitative indicators and evaluations based on qualitative estimates the assessment generally follows a continuum of a stronger or weaker degree of technology sovereignty rather than a simple yesno decision at the same time the different subaspects make it clear that assessments may change over time in this respect technology sovereignty is not a static construct but a dynamic one the fact that the granularity of analysis and the indicators used to implement the criteria can vary is shown by the discussion of two differ ent example applications see page 25 ff wwwisifraunhoferdeinfobox analytical tools for assessing technology sovereigntysummary of several important methods for analyzing technology sovereignty analyzing to what degree technology sovereignty exists requires a mix of methods quantitative indicators based on technologyspecific search algorithms aid these kinds of analyses they should be supported by systematic expert surveys to provide context and validation so that the specificity of each individual technology can be con sidered own competencies and resources patent analyses and derived indicators such as patent shares and specialization map the extent of a state’s or a federation of states’ own technology competencies bibliometric analyses and derived indicators such as publication shares and specialization provide information about the scientific resources and competencies of a state or a federation of states analyses of the contribution of individual countries to global or – leading – national standards possibly in the context of their own patent portfolio enable an estimation of the autonomy of a state or a federation of states in shaping future technology development analyses of technology and resourcespecific production statistics enable the identification of the regional availability of relevant resources and production capacities analyses of technologyspecific export shares provide information about the international competitiveness of the production of a state or a federation of states dependence and access to competencies and resources analyses of international standards patent pools and open source repositories provide information about internationally available technologies that can be used analyses of trade balances grouped and analyzed by technology provide information about the dependence of a state or a federation of states on technologyspecific imports resources and components and their distribution complexity indices make it possible to estimate the dependence of relevant geographical areas on specific technologies and how these technologies are integrated into local or regional innovation and value chains analyses eg of wto compliance enable a concrete assessment of the reliability of potential partner nations in specific issues analyses of the world bank’s world governance index various corruption indices and indices on the form of governance make it possible to assess the basic reliability of potential partner nations finally the results of the individual analyses must be carefully weighed against each other in order to arrive at an overall assessment 18 19strategies for dealing with challenges related to technology sovereignty the above remarks show the numerous perspectives and differentiations that must be applied to determine the degree of technology sovereignty and to draw up counter strategies these conceptual considerations lead to a series of poten tial strategic measures suitable for countering the challenges of technology sover eignty analytical capability to determine the need for technology sovereignty analytical capabilities in the system form the basis for ad dressing the question of which technologies are critical and how to secure access to them methodological and analytical competencies must be available in order to be able to process the main dimensions with regard to technology sovereignty in a technologyspecific manner and with the necessary granu larity sufficient competencies and databases are required to perform the following threedimensional analysis determine the criticality of technologies develop a clear picture of which fundamental economic and social functions this technology helps to fulfill and how it does so ensure access and provide own competencies possible strategic approaches the following strategic approaches can be derived from the three determining factors of technology sovereignty for a country to maintain its own ability to produce the relevant technologies and products in a dynamically developing environment it is first necessary to generate technologyspecific knowledge using the classic instru ments of research and innovation policy this requires a critical mass of knowledge carriers – persons possessing the relevant knowledge – which is only formed by actually teaching the corresponding content at universities eg the gap in professorships in battery technology in addition public procurement can provide strategic impulses so that ultimately production capacities for tech nologies and the corresponding products can be created or ensured however the potential portfolio of technologies is much too large for the majority of national economies to provide the necessary research capacities in all the fields relevant for technology sovereignty further these tech nologies or products often require access to certain raw materials therefore a division of labor is necessary not only in the european context but in an international one which can be initiated for example through longterm research cooperation in such cooperation bilateral but above all multilateral research is conducted with partners who have the relevant complementary competencies in technologies identified as critical which ensures joint access to these technologies and avoids onesided depen dencies wwwisifraunhoferde the development of open standards potentially com bined with patent pools supported by many international companies but also by open source software and hard ware can be regarded as a special form of access these prevent a proprietary monopolization of technologies and therefore dependencies these standards also reduce dependencies on single suppliers within complex value chains and therefore also reduce risks eg standards in the automotive industry increase competition among suppliers if this is combined with public procurement it allows access a larger number of suppliers of the relevant technologies this enhances competition which prevents the dominating companies exerting market power and ensures sustainable competition in the long term in addition to supporting research and demandoriented strategies such as public procurement it makes sense to design the regulatory framework in a way that gives domestic or european industries the right conditions and incentives to develop the corresponding research and therefore also production capacities in fields prospectively at risk of technology dependencies this includes an appropriately designed competition policy which includes the acquisition of european companies by noneuropean concerns if technology sovereignty is limited or no longer present due to already existing dependencies on individual suppli ers attempts can be made over the long term to build up a country’s own research competencies in order to develop substitutes however this is often not possible even in the long term due to resource restrictions furthermore such dependencies usually affect not just one country’s economy but the majority of national economies this is why joint solutions are an option here coordinated by the european union but also by larger international consortia finally in addition to the single european market free world trade with its strong incentives for competition remains an important boundary condition to ensure technology sovereignty compliance with agreed multi lateral regulations should be ensured by strengthening key international organizations such as the wto increasing the resilience of the eu the eu should increase its investments in the resilience of its economic and social systems so that these can recover rapidly from shocks and disruptions and adapt quickly to changing contexts this is an important cornerstone of any consider ation of futureproof technology sovereignty the eu states already have the right prerequisites for this because their economies are strongly oriented towards open competition in addition their societies are influenced by subsidiarity and above all are organized democratically this means the eu’s adaptability is fed by a diverse pool of common economic political scientific and civil society features fostering a broad basis of competencies and capacities in critical technology fields is an important element in lowering the eu’s vulnerability to potential disruptions and shocks – especially in times of increasing global uncertainty in the sense of a systemic approach to resilience technological key capabilities should be promoted innovation networks formed as well as experimental learning encouraged for example in the context of regulatory sandboxes 20 21examples of determining and ensuring technology sovereignty how can we analyze whether technology sovereignty exists in concrete terms and what measures can be taken to ensure it the following two case studies illustrate what such an analysis should look like example 1 5g technologies system boundaries for technology sovereignty the geographical and political frame of reference for 5g technologies is defined by the european area based on the joint european decision for gsm in the early 1990s it is therefore necessary to consider technology sovereignty for 5g within the context of a highly integrated system in political and economic terms 5g is very important for both private sector and public sector functions its economic and societal integration and environmental interdependence are high when considering the shared european culture and set of values which attach great importance to the free exchange of information 5g technologies are very important as a necessary communication infrastructure 5g technologies are therefore highly relevant for public services safeguarding sovereign tasks and ensuring economic success in almost every industrial sector finally the time dimension must be considered when analyzing 5g technologies providing the associated functions in the european area in the short term and longterm resilience are both essential conditions for the technology sovereignty of 5g degree of technology sovereignty the analysis must begin by determining whether the europe an area has the capability to supply these technologies or at least the knowledge required for technology development patent applications are suitable indicators for identifying technology competence see infobox on page 20 a current analysis conducted with the support of fraunhofer isi8 shows that the patents for 5g technologies are indeed strongly influenced by chinese companies but that euro pean enterprises also feature among the internationally most active technology developers at present chinese companies especially huawei and zte account for 33 percent of total 5g patents worldwide south korean enterprises for 27 per cent european companies for 17 percent and usamerican companies for 14 percentnokia and ericsson are two of the internationally leading manufacturers of 5g network components from europe compared to 4g technologies both companies have increased their patent shares in 5g technologies nokia by 239 ericsson by 114 percentage points9 in addition small and mediumsized enterprises that do not receive much attention such as adva optical networking from germany continue to be active as 5g network equipment providers10 intensive efforts are being made in europe to expand the knowledge base for 5g the european graphene flagship11 is one example of this optoelectronic components are being developed here that enable the extremely high switching speeds needed for 5g12 in principle therefore there are at least two important ele ments for achieving technology sovereignty in eu countries the technological production base with internationally lead ing technology companies and a dynamic knowledge base it cannot be stated in principle therefore that a onesided dependency exists on technologies and knowhow developed in china what is the supply risk the discussion usually focuses on huawei as the world market leader for 5g components as already pointed out however there are at least several potential suppliers in europe who are among the world’s leading 5g suppliers but other global regions also offer possibilities especially south korea and the us with 13 percent and 11 percent of all 5g patents samsung and lg electronics south korea are among the top five companies worldwide samsung is ranked second13 after huawei 15 percent major companies in the us include qualcomm 6 percent patent share and intel 4 percent cisco is also expected to become a major player in future14 a differentiated view of the supply risk is therefore required wwwisifraunhoferdein the short term and also from a cost perspective huawei is the most important 5g supplier however alternatives already exist in europe with ericsson and nokia this is also shown by the example of the british vodafone concern which announced at the beginning of 2020 that it would swap huawei hardware for nokia components in securityrelevant areas of its 5g network15 however vodafone expects addi tional costs of around 200 million euros and a possible delay of two to five years for the switch furthermore both south korea and the us reduce the supply risk with several potential suppliers both regions are ranked higher in the world gover nance index than china the us is ahead of south korea but somewhat behind germany16 at the same time the eu has struck a trade deal with south korea which has a positive effect on assessing its reliability as a supplier country are there possible substitutes intensive work on technological alternatives for individual components of 5g technologies is already ongoing within the eu this concerns the required materials and switching elements in particular17 europe is one of the leading innova tion regions in the field of materials optimized materials can among other things help to improve the energy efficiency of 5g technologies and thus address an important technolo gical challenge ericsson and nokia are part of the relevant research networks especially the graphene flagship and therefore have direct access to these globally leading tech nology developments in contrast to competing 5g suppliers from china south korea and the us overall the analysis shows focusing the discussion about technology sovereignty for 5g on the role of huawei and the dependency on china is too narrow in fact applying the criteria to determine technology sovereignty reveals that several aspects already speak for technology sovereignty for 5g in the european area or that at least the potentials for this already exist this differentiated view of technology sovereignty for 5g puts the discussion for the development of suitable strategies for dealing with technology sovereignty on a wider footing what are the possible strategies for dealing with technology sovereignty with regard to 5g in europe our analysis reveals that tech nology sovereignty has multiple layers can be described ana lytically from different perspectives and which issues should be subject to closer examination this results in a more com prehensive picture that can stimulate the discussion of further strategic options for dealing with technology sovereignty in the short term it makes sense to expand supply relation ships with the european 5g suppliers and explore setting up further supply relationships with leading companies from south korea and the us in order to reduce the overall con centration in supply chains developing a european innovation ecosystem would be one way to provide reliable and configurable 5g technolo gies within the eu in the medium term this means that the individual competencies potentials and technologies that already exist today together with the required framework conditions such as european standardization would have to be combined into an overall system this would be supported by different stakeholders from industry research politics and society who perform different functions in the systems key actors at company level would be the network equipment suppliers ericsson and nokia they could form the crystal lization points of this innovation network close relations and dependencies within this network would simultaneously make it more robust 22 23example 2 industry 40 and robotics system boundaries for technology sovereignty the eu forms the geographical and political frame of refer ence for industry 40 and robotics since these technology fields represent key unique selling points of leading europe an countries in a global comparison however since not all european countries have the relevant competencies discus sions here also always have a national component some member states have only low competencies in this field and the density of industrial robots in europe as a whole is below that of china18 still there are relevant competencies within the scope of european institutions and thus at the core of europe’s innovation and industry policy in addition it can be stated that the contribution of tech nology sovereignty to prosperity and value creation in indus try 40 and robotics is mainly realized in the context of global markets although germany was the country with the third highest density of industrial robots after singapore and south korea in 2018 the german market is only about one sixth the size of the chinese one and approximately half the size of the japanese market with germany denmark italy france austria sweden the netherlands luxembourg and finland numerous member states are net exporters of robotics whose technological design capability can be implemented globally especially compared to countries that still have to import complete robots or their core components to a large extent and source these partially from europe and partially from suppliers outside europe19 degree of technology sovereignty almost without exception europe’s major industrial nations have a significantly aboveaverage technology sovereignty in this field which can be documented along various analytical dimensions – from patents through to exports nevertheless there is still a considerable dependence on noneuropean producers with regard to key intermediate inputs in the field of microelectronics however since both the final product and the direct upstream components are still designed and manu factured in europe the main objective of the innovation and industry policy debates in this context is the question of how to preserve or use existing competencies the success of many european nations in the field of advanced manufacturing and especially robotics is based on systemically combining strengths in mechanical and plant engineering with software and hardware for integrated systems europe’s key challenges and its major contributions to solutions are current ly in managing complex industrial application scenarios while guaranteeing the security of networked systems in terms of it various european companies are developing successful ref erence architectures and making major contributions to global standardization and thus to achieving interoperability what is the supply risk there is a supply risk in particular with regard to key hard ware components required in the production of industry 40 and robotic devices the corresponding chips and micro electronic elements are not only no longer manufactured in europe but are also only partially designed here as a result europe is already clearly dependent today on external supply chains for major components and partially also on specific manufacturing skills for example there are only two relevant production sites for microchips left in europe so that a mul titude of basic components now have to be imported mainly from asian countries in the medium term as the technology evolves it is conceiv able that larger shares of value creation will shift to software or hardware components that have not been produced in europe for some time which could lead to increased depen dency on a few large technology companies in the united states or asia although there is not yet any isolated de pendency on individual noneuropean states or companies at present greater concentration is conceivable in the future are there possible substitutes technologies from the field of robotics represent a pivotal component of modern manufacturing systems and cannot be substituted by other technologies from a systemic perspec tive however european companies have already positioned themselves in specific highervalue areas of robotics complex application scenarios guaranteeing security where they are confident and profitable actors thanks to the strength of their existing competencies to a certain extent therefore it should be possible to resubstitute simpler currently imported technologies with corresponding european products should such a switch be required for geopolitical reasons wwwisifraunhoferdeoverall the analysis shows the economic advantage of existing technology sover eignty is usually only fully realizable in a global context it would be a drawback if development perspectives were restricted to certain markets interoperability remains a major goal an already existing dependency in the field of major com ponents could become more significant in future if these components microelectronics themselves become more relevant stronger and more onesided dependencies are possible if core competencies are drained eg due to company ac quisitions there is a danger that key unique selling points will be lost to those demanding specifically european competencies ongoing technology development means that even lead ing companies with high integration competence face the challenge of learning new skills in fields that will become more important a crucial point in this context is to consider to what extent technology sovereignty must be regained in important complementary areas such as cloud and data infrastruc tures what are the possible strategies for dealing with technology sovereignty substantial investments in retaining and updating current and future key competencies in the field of industry 40 and robotics can be observed in many european countries increasingly other countries that want to overcome their current dependency on imports are also making efforts to master these skills and will do so in the medium term government support here often takes place nationally and at european level through the research framework programmes and initiatives for “advanced industrial technologies” these include the targeted funding of technological developments on the one hand but also preventing the strategic acqui sition of existing expertise by noneuropean companies or nations on the other hand in addition funding research cluster initiatives and other alliances is intended to increase cooperation between science and industry and therefore the efficiency and speed of technology transfer – and by using test beds – to not forfeit technological leadership in complex application contexts finally individual member states and numerous european institutions are supporting the participa tion in international standards this is intended to ensure that existing competencies and those still to be developed can be productively integrated into the global value networks of the future and to guarantee the highest possible interoperability for european system solutions there are additional activities to create new basic data infrastructures such as gaiax in which european solutions can be integrated securely efficiently and without being directly dependent on external providers where this is necessary to guarantee data security a multilevel strategy is therefore suitable for the future anticipate technology developments and develop the associated required capacities strengthen and update existing key competencies create a systemic framework cloud and data infrastruc ture within which specifically european competencies can be further developed avoid that key competencies that set european companies apart from international competitors are drained through external acquisitions deliberately spread the supply risk in upstream areas where it does not make sense to develop own competen cies 24 25conclusions global prosperity is built on an international division of labor in terms of indus tries and technologies globallyoriented open trade policies and science net works that span national borders at the same time there is an understandable need for coun tries to preserve or to create a politically autonomous scope of action with the lowest possible structural dependency on competitors with regard to critical technologies in order to keep their own economies competitive in the long term and to be able to meet society’s essential needs the calls for technology sovereignty which are becoming louder and loud er intensified by the current crises and geopolitical shifts are therefore in conflict with a globally networked economy as a guarantor of prosperity especially for europe and germany against this background our concept provides added value through its differentiated view of technology sovereignty and concrete proposals for its analysis this differentiation is based on the current and future criticality of technologies the motivation for technology sovereignty and the basis for producing it ie essentially the access to current and poten tial resources and competencies see figure 2 the interplay of these dimensions can determine the current and desirable degree of technology sovereignty in a specific situation and where required strategies can be developed to preserve or produce itcomprehensive analytical system capacities are required to decide which technologies are critical or will be in future what the key factors are that make technology sovereignty in our defined sense possible and what measures should be taken at which level to achieve this at the same time this must also consider the system conditions that determine how technologies are transformed into functioning innovations on markets such as production capacities infrastructures or demandside conditions finally it requires strategic creativity and foresight to avoid throwing out the baby of germany’s and the eu’s internationally oriented competitiveness with the bathwater of technology sovereignty for germany given the extent of economic and political interdependence and the added value this provides through specialization gains and political stability the frame of reference for technology sovereignty is definitely the eu a renationalization reflex in the face of striving for technology sovereignty would not only be inefficient but even counterproductive in the long run as it would trigger a spiral of protectionism a system that differentiates the challenge posed by technology sovereignty analyzes and processes this in a forwardlooking manner will not only be more adaptable in future and therefore more competitive but also more resilient to external shocks wwwisifraunhoferde figure 2 dimensions used to determine technology sovereigntyoriginal sovereign tasks
