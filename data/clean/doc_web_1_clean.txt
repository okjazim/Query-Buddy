attributes global attributes are attributes common to all html elements they can be used on all elements though they may have no effect on some elements global attributes may be specified on all html elements even those not specified in the standard that means that any nonstandard elements must still permit these attributes even though using those elements means that the document is no longer html5compliant for example html5compliant browsers hide content marked as foo hiddenâ¦foo even though foo is not a valid html element in addition to the basic html global attributes the following global attributes also exist xmllang and xmlbase â these are inherited from the xhtml specifications and deprecated but kept for compatibility purposes the aria role attribute and the multiple aria states and properties used for ensuring accessibility the event handler attributes listed below in this article list of global attributes list of global event handler attributes specifications browser compatibility see also list of global attributes accesskey provides a hint for generating a keyboard shortcut for the current element this attribute consists of a spaceseparated list of characters the browser should use the first one that exists on the computer keyboard layout anchor nonstandard associates a positioned element with an anchor element the attributes value is the id value of the element you want to anchor the positioned element to the element can then be positioned using css anchor positioning autocapitalize controls whether inputted text is automatically capitalized and if so in what manner autocorrect controls whether input text is automatically corrected for spelling errors this can be applied to elements that have editable text except for input elements with the attribute typepassword typeemail or typeurl autofocus indicates that an element is to be focused on page load or as soon as the dialog it is part of is displayed this attribute is a boolean initially false class a spaceseparated list of the classes of the element classes allow css and javascript to select and access specific elements via the class selectors or functions like the method documentgetelementsbyclassname contenteditable an enumerated attribute indicating if the element should be editable by the user if so the browser modifies its widget to allow editing the attribute must take one of the following values true or the empty string which indicates that the element must be editable false which indicates that the element must not be editable plaintextonly which indicates the elements raw text is editable but rich text formatting is disabled data forms a class of attributes called custom data attributes that allow proprietary information to be exchanged between the html and its dom representation that may be used by scripts all such custom data are available via the htmlelement interface of the element the attribute is set on the htmlelementdataset property gives access to them dir an enumerated attribute indicating the directionality of the elements text it can have the following values ltr which means left to right and is to be used for languages that are written from the left to the right like english rtl which means right to left and is to be used for languages that are written from the right to the left like arabic auto which lets the user agent decide it uses a basic algorithm as it parses the characters inside the element until it finds a character with a strong directionality then it applies that directionality to the whole element draggable an enumerated attribute indicating whether the element can be dragged using the drag and drop api it can have the following values true which indicates that the element may be dragged false which indicates that the element may not be dragged enterkeyhint hints what action label or icon to present for the enter key on virtual keyboards exportparts used to transitively export shadow parts from a nested shadow tree into a containing light tree hidden an enumerated attribute indicating that the element is not yet or is no longer relevant for example it can be used to hide elements of the page that cant be used until the login process has been completed the browser wont render such elements this attribute must not be used to hide content that could legitimately be shown id defines a unique identifier id which must be unique in the whole document its purpose is to identify the element when linking using a fragment identifier scripting or styling with css inert a boolean value that makes the browser disregard user input events for the element useful when click events are present inputmode provides a hint to browsers about the type of virtual keyboard configuration to use when editing this element or its contents used primarily on input elements but is usable on any element while in contenteditable mode is allows you to specify that a standard html element should behave like a registered customized builtin element see using custom elements for more details note the item attributes are part of the whatwg html microdata feature itemid the unique global identifier of an item itemprop used to add properties to an item every html element may have an itemprop attribute specified where an itemprop consists of a name and value pair itemref properties that are not descendants of an element with the itemscope attribute can be associated with the item using an itemref it provides a list of element ids not itemid s with additional properties elsewhere in the document itemscope itemscope usually works along with itemtype to specify that the html contained in a block is about a particular item itemscope creates the item and defines the scope of the itemtype associated with it itemtype is a valid url of a vocabulary such as schemaorg that describes the item and its properties context itemtype specifies the url of the vocabulary that will be used to define itemprop s item properties in the data structure itemscope is used to set the scope of where in the data structure the vocabulary set by itemtype will be active lang helps define the language of an element the language that noneditable elements are in or the language that editable elements should be written in by the user the attribute should contain a valid bcp 47 language tag xmllang has priority over it nonce a cryptographic nonce number used once which can be used by content security policy to determine whether or not a given fetch will be allowed to proceed part a spaceseparated list of the part names of the element part names allows css to select and style specific elements in a shadow tree via the part pseudoelement popover used to designate an element as a popover element see popover api popover elements are hidden via display none until opened via an invokingcontrol element ie a button or input typebutton with a popovertarget attribute or a htmlelementshowpopover call role roles define the semantic meaning of content allowing screen readers and other tools to present and support interaction with an object in a way that is consistent with user expectations of that type of object roles are added to html elements using roleroletype where roletype is the name of a role in the aria specification slot assigns a slot in a shadow dom shadow tree to an element an element with a slot attribute is assigned to the slot created by the slot element whose name attributes value matches that slot attributes value spellcheck an enumerated attribute defines whether the element may be checked for spelling errors it may have the following values empty string or true which indicates that the element should be if possible checked for spelling errors false which indicates that the element should not be checked for spelling errors style contains css styling declarations to be applied to the element note that it is recommended for styles to be defined in a separate file or files this attribute and the style element have mainly the purpose of allowing for quick styling for example for testing purposes tabindex an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus is focusable if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation and if so at what position it can take several values a negative value means that the element should be focusable but should not be reachable via sequential keyboard navigation 0 means that the element should be focusable and reachable via sequential keyboard navigation but its relative order is defined by the platform convention a positive value means that the element should be focusable and reachable via sequential keyboard navigation the order in which the elements are focused is the increasing value of the tabindex if several elements share the same tabindex their relative order follows their relative positions in the document title contains a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to such information can typically but not necessarily be presented to the user as a tooltip translate an enumerated attribute that is used to specify whether an elements attribute values and the values of its text node children are to be translated when the page is localized or whether to leave them unchanged it can have the following values empty string or yes which indicates that the element will be translated no which indicates that the element will not be translated virtualkeyboardpolicy experimental an enumerated attribute used to control the onscreen virtual keyboard behavior on devices such as tablets mobile phones or other devices where a hardware keyboard may not be available for elements that its content is editable for example it is an input or textarea element or an element with the contenteditable attribute set auto or an empty string which automatically shows the virtual keyboard when the element is focused or tapped manual which decouples focus and tap on the element from the virtual keyboards state writingsuggestions an enumerated attribute indicating if browserprovided writing suggestions should be enabled under the scope of the element or not false which disables the browsers writing suggestions true or an empty string which enables writing suggestions list of global event handler attributes html event handler attributes are discouraged see html attribute reference for how they work while the attributes listed below apply to all elements they are not useful on all elements for example onvolumechange html attribute is accepted by all elements and attaches an event listener for volumechange but only media elements will ever receive a volumechange event fired by the browser for other elements you can only use eventtargetdispatchevent to manually dispatch one some attributes can be specified on body but they would instead listen to events on window onabort
