or a large ecommerce platform — relies on the same foundation structure style and logic this web development intro explores how those elements come together to form functional engaging and accessible experiences online this post breaks the process down into clear approachable steps it explains what web development involves the skills and tools beginners need to start and the different paths developers can take as they specialize no matter the project understanding these fundamentals marks the true beginning of building for the web table of contents getting started with web development what is website development why is web development important understanding the different types of web developers web development vs web programming web development basics types of web development the website development process frontend web development languages frontend web development roadmap backend web development languages backend web development roadmap website development resources frequently asked questions about web development hubspots free website builder create and customize your own business website with an easy draganddrop website builder build a website without any coding skills prebuilt themes and templates builtin marketing tools and features and more get started for free getting started with web development every website seen online starts with the same foundation that’s why developers must understand how the web works setting up the right tools and learning by building a proper web development intro can help here’s an outline of what beginners should know before they start what tools they need and how to take the first practical steps toward becoming a web developer prerequisites for learning web development before learning web development it helps to have a few basic skills and concepts in place general computer knowledge beginners should be comfortable using a computer managing files and folders and installing software this makes it easier to follow along with coding exercises and tutorials internet fundamentals a basic understanding of how the internet works such as what a website browser and server are creates helpful context for learning web technologies analytical thinking web development often involves solving problems so approaching challenges logically and patiently is an important skill goal setting knowing the reason for learning web development helps narrow the focus for instance business owners may want to build or manage their company’s website while aspiring developers may want to start a career in technology most importantly web development requires consistency regular practice even in small amounts leads to faster progress than occasional bursts of study what you’ll need to begin learning web development requires both hardware and software tools these tools form the foundation for both learning and building real projects hardware a reliable laptop or desktop computer with at least 8gb of ram and a stable internet connection is enough for most beginners higher specifications may be needed later for larger projects or complex applications software web browser a modern browser such as google chrome mozilla firefox or microsoft edge is essential for testing websites each of these browsers includes developer tools that allow inspection of elements layout and code behavior code editor applications like visual studio code sublime text or atom are used to write and edit code visual studio code is especially popular because it’s free and supports many programming languages and extensions version control git is the most widely used system for tracking code changes beginners can create a free github account to store their projects online and collaborate with others programming languages and tools for frontend development html css and javascript are the starting point we’ll cover these in more detail later for backend development a language such as python php java or nodejs is needed along with a database like mysql or postgresql design and testing tools figma for design postman for testing apis and simple text editors or browser extensions for checking accessibility and responsiveness can be helpful as skills progress hosting services platforms like netlify or vercel allow beginners to publish small websites online easily and for free first steps in web development the first steps in web development involve learning how websites are built and displayed in a browser learn how the web works before coding understand how a browser requests data from a server and displays it as a webpage this basic flow shows how html css and javascript work together start with html html defines a website’s structure allowing developers to feature text links images and sections on web pages beginners can practice by building simple pages with headings paragraphs and navigation links learn css for styling css shapes a site’s look with colors fonts and layouts learning flexbox grid and responsive design helps pages adjust smoothly to any screen size add interactivity with javascript javascript brings sites to life start with simple interactions like toggling elements validating forms or updating content dynamically build small projects practice by creating small focused projects like a personal portfolio a todo list or a landing page to apply and reinforce new skills learn to use version control use git to track changes fix errors and collaborate platforms like github or gitlab also serve as online portfolios for sharing work publish a first website deploying a project to the web is an exciting milestone services like netlify vercel or github pages make it simple to upload files and generate a live website link as learners gain confidence they can explore frameworks such as react for frontend or express for backend to handle more advanced projects over time these skills combine to form a complete understanding of how modern websites and applications are created and maintained what is website development web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications this includes everything from markup and coding to scripting network configuration and cms development if someone wants to get started with web development a big part of that will be learning various programming languages depending on their focus these could be frontend languages like html css and javascript or backend languages like python php java ruby and so on frontend development focuses on the visual and interactive parts of a website while backend development handles the serverside logic and databases however learning programming languages isn’t the only part of website development it’s also important to understand how the web works at a basic level especially for anyone interested in backend website development hubspots free website builder create and customize your own business website with an easy draganddrop website builder build a website without any coding skills prebuilt themes and templates builtin marketing tools and features and more get started for free why is web development important right now over 604 billion people are connected through the internet thats more than half of our global population actively engaging in research connection education and entertainment through this incredible digital universe given the rapidly increasing number of internet users it’s no surprise that web development is a rapidly expanding industry between now and 2034 the employment of web developers is expected to grow by 7 which is faster than most other technology careers it’s an exciting time to be in this field and i’m thrilled to be part of this dynamic industry however not every business needs a dedicated web developer many companies use content management systems and templates to design their sites that’s especially true of small and mediumsized businesses with limited budgets for example hubspot content hub provides beginnerfriendly tools and resources for web development wordpress and wix are other popular options understanding the different types of web developers as beginners progress they often start to specialize web development covers several distinct paths each focusing on a different layer of how websites and web applications work some developers concentrate on what visitors see others on the logic and data that power the site behind the scenes and some work across the full spectrum the table below outlines the main types of web developers what each one does and the programming languages and technologies commonly used in their work type of developer what they do languages and tools to know frontend developer focuses on the part of a website that users interact with directly eg layout navigation design and responsiveness translates design mockups into functioning interfaces and ensure websites look and perform well on all devices core languages html css javascript frameworkslibraries react vuejs angular svelte tools git chrome devtools figma vite webpack backend developer works on the server side of web applications managing databases handling user authentication processing logic and ensuring smooth data exchange between server and client languages python php java nodejs ruby c databases mysql postgresql mongodb frameworks express django flask laravel spring boot net fullstack developer builds and maintains both frontend and backend systems designs user interfaces manages servers handles databases and deploys applications endtoend combines frontend and backend skills languages html css javascript react nodejs python or php tools git rest apis docker postman vercelnetlify web designerui developer focuses on the visual design and user experience of a website ensures that the website is easy to navigate visually consistent and aligned with brand identity tools figma adobe xd sketch canva languages basic html and css for layout adjustments knowledge design systems typography color theory accessibility mobile web developer builds responsive websites and progressive web apps pwas optimized for mobile devices focuses on performance offline access and crossdevice compatibility languages html css javascript frameworks react native ionic flutter for web pwa standards tools lighthouse chrome devtools mobile emulators cms developer specializes in building and managing websites using content management systems such as wordpress drupal or hubspot cms customizes themes builds templates and integrates plugins languages html css php javascript cms platforms wordpress drupal joomla hubspot cms webflow tools cpanel ftp database management tools ecommerce developer builds and maintains online stores handles payment gateways product catalogs shopping carts and integrations with crm or erp systems languages html css javascript php liquid shopify or react for headless commerce platforms shopify woocommerce magento bigcommerce apis stripe paypal square web development vs web programming web development and web programming sound very similar — and they are but there’s one very important distinction web development refers to the overall process of creating websites or web applications including the project’s design layout coding content creation and functionality it involves using a combination of programming languages tools and frameworks to bring a website or web application to life web development may also encompass project management activities such as fielding development requests from stakeholders or freelance clients web programming on the other hand specifically refers to the coding and scripting of a website whether the frontend or backend it primarily involves writing code to handle data process user inputs and generate dynamic content a web programmer will rarely if ever handle a large web development project from end to end they may build a certain section of a site or troubleshoot bugs understanding this difference has been crucial in my career allowing me to appreciate the depth and breadth of skills required in the world of web creation its a reminder of the diverse talents and expertise that come together to make the digital world what it is today web development basics what is a website what is an ip address what does http mean what is coding what does frontend mean what does backend mean what is a cms what is cybersecurity 1 what is a website websites are files stored on servers which are computers that host fancy term for “store files for” websites these servers are connected to a giant network called the internet now how do people access these websites this is where browsers come into play browsers are computer programs that load websites via an internet connection such as google chrome or safari while the computers used to access these websites are known as “clients” 2 what is an ip address an internet protocol ip address is a unique string of numbers each device has an ip address to distinguish itself from the billions of websites and devices connected via the internet the ip address for hubspot is currently 10416118116 anyone can find a website’s ip address by visiting a site like site 24x7 or by using command prompt on windows or network utility traceroute on macbooks if this sounds new that’s because most people have been using domain names to reach websites while a website can be accessed using its ip address most internet users prefer to use domain names or search engines domain names are connected to website server ips using something called the domain name system dns to be a web developer its essential to understand how dns works pro tip to find a device’s ip address type “what’s my ip address” into a search engine 3 what does http mean hypertext transfer protocol http is what connects a website request to the remote server that houses all website data it’s a set of rules a protocol that defines how messages should be sent over the internet it allows users to jump between site pages and websites if a person types a website into a web browser or searches for something through a search engine http provides a framework so that the client computer and server can speak the same language when they make requests and responses to each other over the internet it’s essentially the translator between the web user and the internet http reads a website request reads the code sent back from the server and translates it into a visible website understanding http is important for all aspects of web development but its especially essential for anyone interested in backend development 4 what is coding coding refers to writing code for servers and applications using programming languages they’re called “languages” because they include vocabulary and grammatical rules for communicating with computers they also include special commands abbreviations and punctuation that can only be read by devices and programs all software is written in at least one coding language but languages vary based on platform operating system and style all languages fall into one of two categories frontend and backend pro tip sometimes businesses seek a fullstack developer this means that the developer has expertise in both the front end and the back end 5 what does frontend mean frontend or clientside is the side of a website or software that people see and interact with as an internet user when website information is transferred from a server to a browser frontend coding languages allow the website to function without having to continually “communicate” with the internet frontend code allows users to interact with a website and play videos expand or minimize images highlight text and more web developers who work on frontend coding work on clientside development hubspots free website builder create and customize your own business website with an easy draganddrop website builder build a website without any coding skills prebuilt themes and templates builtin marketing tools and features and more get started for free 6 what does backend mean on the contrary the backend or serverside is the side that people don’t see when they use the internet it’s digital infrastructure to nondevelopers it looks like a bunch of numbers letters and symbols there are more backend coding languages than frontend languages that’s because browsers the front end only understand html css and javascript meanwhile a server the back end can be configured to understand pretty much any language 7 what is a cms a content management system cms is a web application or a series of programs used to create and manage web content note a cms isnt necessarily the same thing as a site builder such as squarespace or wix while not required to build a website using a cms makes things easier it provides the building blocks like plugins and addons and lets developers create the structure with their code hubspot cms for example offers draganddrop functionality users can build a website without knowing how to code pro tip a cms is often used for ecommerce and blogging but its useful for all types of websites it can be especially helpful for businesses that need to display and organize large amounts of data see why thousands of customers use content hub to build a website that integrates with their hubspot crm data and marketing suite 8 what is cybersecurity there are always malicious actors looking to find vulnerabilities in websites to expose private information steal data and crash servers cybersecurity is the practice of securing data networks and computers from these threats the methods used by hackers are constantly evolving as are the security measures taken to defend against them failing to understand how a site could be targeted could result in disaster as a result a basic understanding of cybersecurity best practices is critical for effective web development developers should also carry out security audits on a consistent basis this ensures that websites do not fall victim to bad actors attempting to steal sensitive information types of web development frontend development backend development full stack development website development desktop development mobile development game development embedded development security development these different types of web development primarily refer to the different sectors of the profession in which web developers can work some of these distinctions overlap and web developers will often master multiple types of web development while a web development intro won’t teach a developer each language they should know the difference 1 frontend development frontend developers work on the client or userfacing side of websites programs and software this is what users see they design and develop the visual aspects including the layout navigation graphics and other aesthetics frontend developers build interfaces that help users reach their goals they also often work on the user experience aspect of their projects 2 backend development if the front end is what users see the back end is what they don’t backend web developers work on the servers of websites programs and software to make sure everything works properly behind the scenes these developers work with systems like servers operating systems apis and databases and manage the code for security content and site architecture they collaborate with frontend developers to bring their products to users 3 full stack development fullstack development combines frontend and backend skills fullstack developers can create a website application or software program from start to finish “stack” refers to the different technologies that handle different functionalities on the same website like the server interface etc because fullstack developers require years in the field to build the necessary experience this role is often sought after by companies looking to build or update their websites the developers allaround knowledge helps them optimize performance catch issues before they occur and help team members understand different parts of a web service this comprehensive skill set is typically covered in a fullstack developer course to be wellversed in all things web development take one of these courses 4 website development website developers can be frontend backend or fullstack developers however these professionals specialize in building websites as opposed to mobile applications desktop software or video games 5 desktop development desktop developers specialize in building software applications that run locally on devices rather than over the internet in a web browser sometimes the skill set of these developers overlaps with web developers if an application can run both online and off 6 mobile development mobile developers build applications for mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets mobile apps operate much differently than other websites and software programs thus requiring a separate set of development skills and knowledge of specialized programming languages even for those not building a mobile application it’s important to ensure that a website is mobilefriendly 7 game development game developers specialize in writing code for video games including console games xbox playstation etc pc games and mobile games which means this specialty overlaps somewhat with mobile development 8 embedded development embedded developers work with all hardware that isnt a computer or at least what most of us imagine as “computers” with a keyboard and screen this includes electronic interfaces consumer devices iot devices realtime systems and more with a recent rise in interconnected devices demand is growing for embedded development 9 security development security developers establish methods and procedures for securing software programs or websites they typically work as ethical hackers trying to “break” websites to expose vulnerabilities without intending harm they also build systems that discover and eradicate security risks the website development process once the basics of web development are clear the next step is to understand how a website actually comes to life from defining goals to writing code and launching a finished product each phase plays an essential role in the overall process 1 form a plan before laying pen to paper or hands to keyboard its vital to first connect with teams and personnel across an organization to develop a plan for the website here are some questions to consider before the first site draft what is the goal of the website who is the audience and what should visitors do on the website what type of website is being built eg basic information membership online store what content is being published and at what volume what’s the purpose of this content how will the website be structured for the best navigational experience what’s the budget answering the questions requires interfacing with web development marketing and financial teams to determine priorities and make informed decisions put simply it’s much easier to create a roadmap at the beginning of the process than to reverse progress at a roadblock it‘s especially important that the entire team is on the same page so ensure consistent communication among all team members 2 create a wireframe all good websites start with a blueprint developers call this a wireframe it doesn’t have to be an official document it’s simply a vision for the site that’ll give both the project team and the developers direction and a place to start it can be drawn on a whiteboard or created using a tool like figma slickplan or mindnode wireframes are strictly visual tools that help identify where text and images will go on individual web pages blank boxes and “ dummy text ” can be used to get an idea of how content will appear on the front end when working with a company or freelancer creating a wireframe provides a shared understanding of what the final product will be 3 draft up a sitemap next it’s time to create a sitemap not to be confused with sitemapxml which is an xml file that helps search engines crawl and find a site just like a business plan gives a potential investor insight into goals and deliverables a sitemap gives a developer the information needed to meet the project vision the sitemap can be created internally or in collaboration with developers here are a few questions to ask during site planning what individual pages are needed what content will be on those pages how can those pages be organized into categories what is the hierarchy of pages on the site how will the pages link together what pages and categories are essential to user experience which pages or categories could be removed or combined it’s a good idea to consult with other teams within the organization if an seo andor content strategy team exists their input will be critical in determining linking structure and page categorization 4 build the back end of the website writing code might be one of the more complicated parts of web development but it’s hardly the only component it’s also necessary to build the backend and frontend site structures and design the back end handles the data which enables functionality on the front end for example facebooks back end stores photos so that the front end can then allow others to view them it’s made up of two key components databases are responsible for storing organizing and processing data so that it’s retrievable by server requests servers are the hardware and software that make up a computer servers are responsible for sending processing and receiving data requests they’re the intermediary between the database and the clientbrowser the browser will in effect tell the server a piece of information is needed and the server will know how to get that information from the database and send it to the client these components work together to build the foundation for each website as for building the website backend developers will establish three things logic code which is a set of rules for how the website will respond to certain requests and how objects will interact database management which defines how the website will organize manage and retrieve its data infrastructure which determines how the site will be hosted hosting a site independently provides greater control but is more expensive and requires maintaining server health and security alternatively managed hosting providers like kinsta or wp engine can simplify the process these platforms handle infrastructure optimizing performance and ensuring security updates are managed automatically with these components and decisions in place the website will be ready for frontend development note the backend is slightly tangential to web development because a backend isn’t always needed if no data is being stored “data” in this context means any userentered information that needs to be saved and persisted consider logging in to a website if the website doesnt have a backend it cannot remember login information or profile settings a backend is required to retrieve this information facebook for example needs to know who is on each user’s friends list what events they have joined what posts they have created and more this is all “data” that lives in a database without a backend and database none of that data would be accessible on the other hand a website that’s purely informational and doesn’t require users to enter any data wouldn’t need a backend so if no data is required a backend isn’t necessary hubspots free website builder create and customize your own business website with an easy draganddrop website builder build a website without any coding skills prebuilt themes and templates builtin marketing tools and features and more get started for free 5 build the front end of the website anyone who has dabbled in web design or experimented with a website in wordpress squarespace or google sites has worked with frontend web development the frontend component is important it’s what visitors customers and users see and how they interact with a website frontend or clientside development includes a combination of javascript html and css it also controls components such as typography and fonts navigation positioning browser compatibility and responsiveness this part reflects the initial site vision and what was included in the wireframe as technology and consumer preferences evolve clientside coding tends to become outdated faster than backend development this is where coding resources and continuous learning become essential 6 optional work with a cms a cms or content management system offers an alternative to coding “by hand” or “from scratch” while a cms is less flexible and offers less control over the front end it is easier to use and requires less coding a cms often includes tools for hosting the site creating web pages storing user information publishing blogs creating landing pages capturing leads and even building email lists this allows websites to become more profitable with significantly less effort cms options frequently include plugins that eliminate the need to write a backend for instance wordpress offers ecommerce plugins that eliminate the need for a complex backend to process payments manually popular content management systems include hubspot cms joomla magento and wordpress which holds around 607 of market share in this case the reference is to opensource wordpress software not the wordpresscom site builder 7 acquire a domain name at this point the website will have an ip address it also needs a domain name which is a memorable website name that visitors can use to find the site it’s also necessary to ensure the desired domain name isn’t already in use sites like godaddy and hover help users purchase a domain name and register with icann internet corporation for assigned names and numbers most domain registrations are valid for one year before renewal is required website builders and hosting services like wordpresscom and squarespace also allow domain name purchases 8 launch the site once a domain name has been set up and linked to the host the website is almost ready to go live before launch however there are still a few important steps to complete these tasks include assigning team responsibilities conducting thorough prototype testing to identify glitches optimizing the site for seo and performing a final prelaunch review it’s also essential to address all legal requirements for an online website such as displaying a privacy and cookie policy compliance plays a vital role in preventing potential legal issues yet it’s often overlooked frontend web development languages frontend web development focuses on creating the visual and interactive elements of a site it involves designing and building the userfacing side — what visitors see essentially when a site is opened in a web browser these languages are often taught during a web development intro from my perspective frontend development is likely the “easiest” way to begin a career in web development that said as with any other aspect of this field it will have a learning curve that’s explained later here are some of the most popular frontend web development languages understanding these will be essential for a frontend developer html hypertext markup language html is likely the language most people first think of when it comes to web development and with good reason html is the backbone of any web page it provides both semantic structure and defines the elements of a website such as headings paragraphs images and links web developers use html to give content a proper layout before customizing it css cascading style sheets if html is the backbone of a site then css is the muscle css is responsible for styling the visual appearance of a website it allows developers to customize colors fonts layouts and other design elements with css developers can also create responsive web pages that adapt to different screen sizes while developers can always write their own css from scratch there are also many css frameworks that can help them more quickly and easily style a website javascript javascript is a dynamic programming language that adds interactive elements to web pages such as dropdown menus sliders forms and animations javascript is widely used for clientside scripting that is the script runs on the client’s browser and not on the server that hosts the website javascript generally enhances the user experience by making websites more dynamic and engaging there are also a number of popular javascript frameworks and libraries that can help including jquery and react frontend languages play a crucial role in creating visually appealing intuitive and interactive websites don’t underestimate them a website may have the best backend structure but unless the ui is modern interactive and userfriendly it won’t be as appealing to a visitor frontend web development roadmap here’s a roadmap that outlines the general process for learning frontend web development basically to get started with frontend web development do things in this order understand the basics of how websites work learn html to create a basic web page use css to style the web page add interactivity with javascript deploy a website expand knowledge understand the basics of how websites work before writing any code it’s important to start by learning how websites and the internet function understanding these basic principles creates the groundwork for everything else in web development here are some of the key areas and questions to focus on when starting out how devices communicate on the internet what http is and how it works what https is and how it works domain names and the domain name system dns how web browsers work at a fundamental level how apis work application programming interface what the document object model dom is learn html to create a basic web page html is the foundation of frontend website development once the basic principles of how websites work are understood learning html becomes the next logical step on the frontend roadmap beginners can explore hubspot’s beginner’s guide to html for practical tips on getting started or try beginnerfriendly html projects to apply new skills codecademy also offers a free html course that covers all the key fundamentals of the language source use css to style the web page html forms the structure of a web page but adding css is what gives it visual appeal css controls the design elements of a website including colors fonts layouts and spacing hubspot’s ultimate guide to css provides a thorough introduction along with other guides to some specific aspects of css including classes and selectors box model flexbox codecademy also offers a free css course that complements the html course to work more efficiently developers can also explore css frameworks learning popular frameworks like bootstrap or tailwind css can significantly speed up styling and introduce more advanced design capabilities add interactivity with javascript with just html and css developers can create wellstructured and visually appealing websites to make websites interactive learn javascript javascript adds functionality that responds to user actions such as button clicks animations or dynamic content updates codecademy has a great free course on javascript that covers core concepts including conditionals functions scope arrays and loops deploy a website after building a basic website with html css and javascript the next step is deployment or making the website accessible to users around the world if the website does not require any backend functionality it can be hosted on various free or paid platforms cloudflare pages netlify and vercel are popular options for hosting static websites deployment typically involves uploading project files to a host and connecting a custom domain expand knowledge once comfortable with html css and javascript a developer has a solid foundation in frontend web development continuing to build on this foundation is key to longterm growth some areas worth exploring include learning additional frontend languages experimenting with different javascript and css libraries to find some that fit specific project needs learning some backend development to build more advanced websites working with offtheshelf content management systems like hubspot content hub wordpress webflow and so on backend web development languages while frontend developers focus on creating the userfacing elements of a website backend developers work behind the scenes to ensure everything runs smoothly without backend developers doing so frontend developers wouldnt be able to go in and get their job done here are some of the most common backend web development languages most go beyond a web development intro but are helpful to be familiar with python python is a versatile and more beginnerfriendly programming language known for its readability and simplicity it offers a wide range of frameworks such as django and flask that simplify backend development tasks like database management and handling http requests pythons extensive libraries and frameworks make it a popular choice among backend developers source in addition to backend development python also has a ton of other use cases for automation data analysis and more this makes it one of the most versatile backend development languages to learn php php is a widely used serverside scripting language specifically designed for web development it seamlessly integrates with html and provides powerful features for handling databases generating dynamic content and interacting with web servers popular php frameworks like laravel and symfony enhance productivity and maintainability for complex web applications wordpress also relies heavily on php so learning this language is essential for working with wordpress ruby ruby is a dynamic and objectoriented programming language that prioritizes simplicity and readability it is most commonly associated with the ruby on rails framework which provides a structure for building robust and scalable web applications rubys elegant syntax and extensive ecosystem make it a preferred choice for web development projects java java is a versatile and widely used programming language known for its platform independence and scalability it is commonly used for building enterpriselevel web applications that require high performance and security java frameworks like spring and hibernate offer tools for building complex backend systems with ease c c pronounced csharp is a modern generalpurpose programming language developed by microsoft it is primarily used for building windows desktop applications and web services with the rise of the net framework c has gained popularity as a backend language for developing scalable and secure web applications nodejs nodejs is a javascript runtime that is the environment where javascript code executes built on chromes v8 javascript engine it allows developers to run javascript code on the server side opening up opportunities for fullstack javascript development nodejs is highly scalable efficient and ideal for building realtime applications and apis source remember backend developers need to have a solid understanding of databases server management and web security in addition to their language proficiency that’s why backend development is generally harder than frontend development but it’s still learnable nonetheless backend web development roadmap because backend development can be a little more complex than frontend development this roadmap will look a little more complex than the frontend development roadmap here are a few key steps along the journey choose a language and framework to get started learn about version control and repo hosting learn about databases learn about apis learn how security works learn how testing works learn how to deploy web apps hubspots free website builder create and customize your own business website with an easy draganddrop website builder build a website without any coding skills prebuilt themes and templates builtin marketing tools and features and more get started for free choose a language and framework to get started the next step is choosing a backend language to use when getting started as skills develop learning additional languages will help improve versatility however when beginning with
